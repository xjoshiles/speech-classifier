00001	Please call Stella.
00002	Ask her to bring these things with her from the store.
00003	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob.
00004	We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids.
00005	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
00006	When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
00007	The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors.
00008	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
00009	There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
00010	People look, but no one ever finds it.
00011	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
00012	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways.
00013	Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation.
00014	To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods.
00015	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
00016	Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically.
00017	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
00018	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
00019	Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
00020	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases.
00021	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows.
00022	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow.
00023	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.
00024	Why do you want to come to Edinburgh?
00025	How are you, sir?
00026	So is that it, then?
00027	Do I have a favourite?
00028	What do we do?
00029	People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background.
00030	It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much.
00031	A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months.
00032	It was a close call.
00033	In fact, they are the future of investment.
00034	Diving is no part of football.
00035	However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials.
00036	You'd better believe it.
00037	It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council.
00038	People were determined to change the Government in the last election.
00039	No details of the talks were given.
00040	I have learned from him.
00041	We are committed to the ban.
00042	Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room.
00043	I have made that offer.
00044	Four other charges were dropped.
00045	Clearly, it can go either way.
00046	However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result.
00047	However, the problem is the timing.
00048	But retail banking would be run from Halifax.
00049	Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses.
00050	Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world.
00051	I was very pleased with them today, though.
00052	Both sides have been hit by injury.
00053	It could take some time.
00054	There is no pressure on us.
00055	It is a job creation scheme.
00056	Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help.
00057	That is bound to happen.
00058	He is in the queue.
00059	What kind of man does that, Mr Dick?
00060	So, did she meet him?
00061	I had no intention of misleading anyone.
00062	That view is held by many others within the industry.
00063	Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll.
00064	He is delighted, and he has every right to be.
00065	In fact, he should never have been in the field.
00066	Officers recovered a second body in the area.
00067	I did not have a bet on myself.
00068	There is a contract in existence for Allan.
00069	That's as it should be.
00070	Everyone deserves to share in this success.
00071	His is a success story by any standard.
00072	Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants.
00073	That might help a bit.
00074	Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor.
00075	It isn't a happy memory.
00076	The big issue for us is the review.
00077	I told him I was a long time ago.
00078	Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots.
00079	Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits.
00080	We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro.
00081	We suffered a lot for seven years.
00082	The industry is not well organised.
00083	You get a lot for your money.
00084	I didn't feel under any pressure.
00085	It is the latter which has prompted the warning.
00086	As for the warning, it was not needed.
00087	The squad is too small.
00088	It is a common problem.
00089	Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg.
00090	Another High Street retailer was not so lucky.
00091	I think he's the favourite.
00092	We have seen a copy of the report.
00093	But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government.
00094	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing.
00095	Well, you can have a tree.
00096	Russell did not appeal the committee's decision.
00097	She will do for me.
00098	Why change it?
00099	Does the name matter?
00100	Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme.
00101	But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company.
00102	Nothing has been put into action.
00103	The weather forecast isn't good.
00104	We have a clean bill of health.
00105	I would like to see the figures for the second quarter.
00106	He was asked to quit.
00107	Inside, the atmosphere was quiet.
00108	Neither side can win this war.
00109	The Internet is no substitute for customer service.
00110	Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call.
00111	Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry.
00112	The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council.
00113	Nobody did in those days.
00114	But the story of the play is worth a play in itself.
00115	He was a big influence on our decision to make this show.
00116	At that point, the structure of the board was changed.
00117	Treatment is not an issue with these people.
00118	The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton.
00119	They know no other way.
00120	We are just glad to be alive.
00121	People will ask about us.
00122	However, this idea is never developed.
00123	It's very difficult to find a buyer.
00124	It is hard to tell.
00125	I think, therefore I am?
00126	Who was she?
00127	And they were being paid?
00128	It looked like a river.
00129	The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts.
00130	The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year.
00131	They have the cash and the fire power.
00132	You are a great player.
00133	Scotland will play its part.
00134	He added that he was very sad about O Neill.
00135	After that nothing could save him.
00136	We used to live with dignity in our country.
00137	They did not attack the themes of the book.
00138	He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland.
00139	It's all change at Kilmarnock.
00140	In each case they were a goal down.
00141	The police have an awful lot to explain.
00142	He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda.
00143	It is good for our team.
00144	I always felt that I was in control of the match.
00145	That will be the criteria for the future.
00146	Frankly, we were lucky to get second.
00147	Paterson can afford to be generous.
00148	In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game.
00149	We are in the hat.
00150	Well, they were the unlucky ones.
00151	The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days.
00152	The irony was not lost.
00153	What was the matter for concern?
00154	Does that put pressure on us?
00155	Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars.
00156	The problem was a social problem.
00157	My son was too young to die.
00158	We were not allowed to go to help them.
00159	That should be the subject matter of a public debate.
00160	It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland.
00161	No other vehicle was involved in the crash.
00162	I realised I was lucky to have it.
00163	He has not created a Festival resource.
00164	We have not reached the point of no return.
00165	Similar measures are expected in England and Wales.
00166	He will make an excellent chief inspector.
00167	It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence.
00168	Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise.
00169	Sadly, the revival could not be sustained.
00170	They were not at the property yesterday.
00171	It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow.
00172	We have to break that cycle.
00173	I wanted to change the formula.
00174	She said the charity would continue to monitor the case.
00175	Motherwell have no such good fortune.
00176	Scotch beef is badly missed.
00177	We would hope to make progress on that next year.
00178	It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players.
00179	However, we had no failures in our side.
00180	Clydesdale Bank declined to comment.
00181	It goes back a long way.
00182	Innocent people have a right to live in safety.
00183	It was deployed in the Gulf War.
00184	They had to learn to work from the consumer back.
00185	I can hardly believe it.
00186	I must do something about it.
00187	Three hours later, the man was free.
00188	And it had been a marvellous occasion.
00189	Cast Away now on general release.
00190	I thought his speech was a disgrace.
00191	Are they free?
00192	What are they for?
00193	Do they think anyone else wants them?
00194	We believe the world has too many refugees already.
00195	The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand.
00196	It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy.
00197	At the moment, it is very difficult to know.
00198	The problem was he thought you were a big man.
00199	There's still a bit to go.
00200	We have a good healthy debate.
00201	Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources.
00202	It is a court case.
00203	There is no plan B.
00204	The court was shown a video of the house on that day.
00205	He will go a long way.
00206	It is just a tax on employment.
00207	There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh.
00208	We are a peaceful people.
00209	Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure.
00210	It's difficult to predict the future.
00211	Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed.
00212	We are in the end game.
00213	I came into this world with nothing.
00214	But they have the sound.
00215	It wasn't a flight of fancy.
00216	Boy is the town a mess.
00217	Does it matter?
00218	How do you take them away?
00219	However, there is an issue, isn't there?
00220	After the match, do you?
00221	He was then replaced by Ross.
00222	The pain was almost too much to bear.
00223	This action reflects a slump in bookings.
00224	Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal.
00225	I said he was set to retire.
00226	It is a sign of hope.
00227	The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk.
00228	But we welcome this document.
00229	There is The Beautiful Game to write.
00230	You did not see it.
00231	It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet.
00232	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
00233	He has not been named.
00234	That's no bad thing.
00235	They should have a major rethink about the event for next year.
00236	Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed.
00237	We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent.
00238	Because we do not need it.
00239	This is the window.
00240	I was an athlete.
00241	From that day on we started to look for another full back.
00242	Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist.
00243	It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise.
00244	It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies.
00245	It has failed.
00246	It was clear.
00247	It is not for any other purpose.
00248	Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this.
00249	Is there a new way forward?
00250	Mexico City was a wonderful experience.
00251	This represents a tough game for us.
00252	Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison.
00253	We need to chat.
00254	It's a blessing.
00255	But it might have done.
00256	Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland.
00257	It has been a horrible, horrible time.
00258	It is the whole package.
00259	He had no enemies.
00260	I got a great response from the players, as I had expected.
00261	However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress.
00262	For the meantime, though, the signs are good.
00263	It's the big omission.
00264	Next league matches Celtic.
00265	She's a spy!
00266	It is unique.
00267	It is not a process which can be completed overnight.
00268	This is a scheme that has a lot of potential.
00269	It's a real challenge.
00270	It is not great art.
00271	You do not change overnight.
00272	Art is extra.
00273	It's a matter of balance.
00274	Scotland had great assets.
00275	I've spent a lot of time on buses.
00276	There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music.
00277	I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset.
00278	The script was funny.
00279	You need a trademark.
00280	Painful, but only because it's true.
00281	Help is needed.
00282	Tommy is not a problem.
00283	There could be a way back.
00284	Neither it is.
00285	The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow.
00286	It is a terrible place.
00287	It works for us.
00288	I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February.
00289	It can be halted.
00290	This is the way things should be handled.
00291	Detection is often difficult.
00292	He seems to be pleased with the picture.
00293	New Zealand rugby is totally different.
00294	Someone who cares
00295	It's just awful.
00296	It's never too late.
00297	Every time I play I do not understand their reaction.
00298	That will come after the game on Saturday.
00299	However, it did not end that way.
00300	We could not get any possession.
00301	If you could find it.
00302	He is hungry for success and I am the same.
00303	They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs.
00304	It was mayhem.
00305	I am not willing to say anything about any couple.
00306	They were outside the circle.
00307	However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full.
00308	May not have been at fault?
00309	It was some time before she found out he was safe.
00310	It was a good performance.
00311	That time is not now, however.
00312	Oil embargo endorsed.
00313	Before the game we went for a pint.
00314	It was an adventure.
00315	The eye was badly closed on Sunday.
00316	The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this.
00317	It was really enjoyable on Saturday.
00318	I did not think about the Ryder Cup.
00319	It is normal.
00320	I don't have many friends.
00321	We have to look at everything before we make any final decision.
00322	Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee.
00323	It would not do any harm to reinforce the message.
00324	Maybe this battle has been.
00325	This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election.
00326	She's got to say something.
00327	It is a delight on every level.
00328	We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors.
00329	I felt very strongly that England should have it.
00330	She has been shot.
00331	I thought it was a fantastic game.
00332	I was furious.
00333	Child abuse is a dreadful thing.
00334	She really suffered for her art.
00335	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation.
00336	I do not think this family will ever get over this.
00337	Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't.
00338	It will be too hot.
00339	The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk.
00340	I am now unemployed.
00341	They made such decisions in London.
00342	Our intentions are real.
00343	Government will intervene.
00344	Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general.
00345	Police could not say if the two incidents were connected.
00346	On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door.
00347	It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions.
00348	Three penalties were given.
00349	In this case, the farmer had actually given permission.
00350	We just had a go.
00351	That could mean the difference between life and death in action.
00352	That group reported just before Christmas.
00353	Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power.
00354	It's an issue that will have to be tackled.
00355	The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday.
00356	Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday.
00357	We will turn the corner.
00358	The weather affected the other two games in Fife.
00359	They should stop the bombing.
00360	These days are long gone.
00361	It is an attitude of mind.
00362	I've learned from my mistakes.
00363	They say that vital evidence was not heard in court.
00364	We have to move forward.
00365	However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands.
00366	They will do their own thing.
00367	It is too much for me.
00368	A helpline number is published at the end of this article.
00369	It became a book by itself.
00370	His team management was protective.
00371	It's quite a routine.
00372	It is not either national standards or local control.
00373	If that's the case, he will struggle.
00374	I took the gun.
00375	Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked.
00376	No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death.
00377	I have the first six months of next season to prove myself.
00378	I've been there.
00379	I have no sympathy with her at all.
00380	It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait.
00381	It is not fair.
00382	It just came into my head that day.
00383	I had a train to catch.
00384	Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval.
00385	The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment.
00386	Suddenly, the rugby world had changed.
00387	Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender.
00388	The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date.
00389	It is a case of taking a risk.
00390	It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work.
00391	There was no option.
00392	Is that it?
00393	We live by the rule of law.
00394	Is that success?
00395	The service from the other players was super.
00396	They are in the euro.
00397	The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring.
00398	The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office.
00399	I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling.
00400	Some realism was needed about time, resources and management.
00401	It's a mixture of everything.
00402	I don't want to use it.
00403	Now, it's all right.
00404	It's like a garage.
00405	But I am a worried man.
00406	They like being on the front pages of the newspapers.
00407	Feel the heat?
00408	I'm pleased about one thing.
00409	I am delighted for Simon.
00410	His third goal was superb.
00411	It's not ideal.
00412	I was so nervous.
00413	I might come back.
00414	For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon.
00415	Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement.
00416	But we have not heard a thing from Diego.
00417	It was a miserable afternoon in Fife.
00418	A career as a doctor is on hold.
00419	At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher.
00420	Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval.
00421	I am immensely sad.
00422	I'd never seen a play about me.
00423	The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia.
00424	The track is currently covered in snow.
00425	My wife and family are the support system.
00426	Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable.
00427	Stewart will travel with some confidence.
00428	Police later said the scheme would end in November.
00429	It is set in Paris.
00430	It is not an option, but a policy requirement.
00431	Hospitals are for the ill.
00432	It would still have been a good film, but very different.
00433	She is well balanced.
00434	They are all bright and different.
00435	It's only fair.
00436	We lost our composure towards the interval, he said.
00437	I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday.
00438	His body was never found.
00439	We did not compete with any other local farmer.
00440	I was shocked.
00441	I should think so, too.
00442	There's the mix.
00443	There will be widespread support on all sides.
00444	I was never going to play against Scotland.
00445	At the end of the day, one has to be careful.
00446	That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective.
00447	Blair is very positive at European Councils.
00448	Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites.
00449	That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match.
00450	Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom.
00451	It is a mark of respect from the inmates.
00452	He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention.
00453	Today we can say that a new era has begun.
00454	I would have the hammer in the crowd.
00455	This court has made an order which has not been observed.
00456	The work between the musicians and the fire is very important.
00457	The warning is timely.
00458	George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks.
00459	That decision is for the British Parliament and people.
00460	They are never here.
00461	We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter.
00462	He was popular.
00463	Frankly, we should all have such problems.
00464	She has every confidence in his performance of his duties.
00465	It's a way of life.
00466	I feel pretty good.
00467	In essence, the teaching profession has a choice.
00468	He has a wealth of experience.
00469	It happens from time to time.
00470	He looked very sharp.
00471	Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident.
00472	It was a virus.
00473	Yet, it worked.
00474	Who will perform?
00475	The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together.
00476	This is a national crisis.
00477	Scotland were beaten again.
00478	He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained.
00479	The results are sometimes contentious.
00480	He should have won.
00481	If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world.
00482	There's a pause.
00483	The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland.
00484	There was no hint of scandal.
00485	I thought it was my only chance.
00486	However, the snow was welcomed by some.
00487	Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman.
00488	One was a lawyer.
00489	Our task is to complete the picture.
00490	A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election.
00491	The whole matter is somewhat in the air.
00492	This is a war over our home.
00493	In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge.
00494	It is no country for a man or woman of letters.
00495	I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions.
00496	It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing.
00497	The minister is the engineer.
00498	I did not name it.
00499	It was a question of patience.
00500	The whole region is in shock.
00501	It's about my time as a guitarist.
00502	Kids are terrible.
00503	Craig is a major concern for us.
00504	The home team had an amazing start.
00505	My body is clearly capable.
00506	Referees are easy targets.
00507	He said she was mad.
00508	I am very happy to be here.
00509	The airport was even different.
00510	We do the same.
00511	That's the law of the land.
00512	But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament.
00513	The weekly average was three hours.
00514	Donald was his friend.
00515	I am so upset.
00516	It was no secret that I wanted to sign him.
00517	On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research.
00518	The boat was fantastic.
00519	It is a time bomb.
00520	I'd like to take the plunge.
00521	Later in the day he was forced to explain his position.
00522	My view has now completely changed.
00523	You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel.
00524	In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times.
00525	Three years ago he would have been.
00526	I'm so pleased the show has won a prize.
00527	He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French.
00528	They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance.
00529	But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party.
00530	It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition.
00531	Look at the witnesses.
00532	He's been the key to everything.
00533	That is the very reason why it was so vital.
00534	This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required.
00535	His contract was then not renewed.
00536	A report is the first step in a criminal case in India.
00537	That is a break with tradition.
00538	A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company.
00539	She is free.
00540	I kept going for her.
00541	You must have a government and a good civil service.
00542	He's very explosive.
00543	No other job in world football can compare to this one.
00544	Our numbers are small.
00545	Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported.
00546	Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment.
00547	This is a club on the rise.
00548	I have got a wife to feed.
00549	It's not pretty, but it's effective.
00550	Equity declined to comment.
00551	All the investment is possible through the public sector.
00552	He took over our lives.
00553	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain.
00554	Meetings will also remain private.
00555	Movement has to take place.
00556	I feel I did not have enough time.
00557	We will look into it.
00558	This is a central issue.
00559	Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy.
00560	The Premier League has been a huge success.
00561	There, you were just a body.
00562	President Bush is at war.
00563	I became a widow overnight.
00564	Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man.
00565	She hopes to study in Britain one day.
00566	Among them are many criminals.
00567	Yesterday, he was busy in his office.
00568	He looks like an Afghan.
00569	It will concentrate on the Thames Valley.
00570	I'd come back from London.
00571	If I was a woman.
00572	He was a home referee.
00573	There was no safety net.
00574	The casting of her husband was an accident.
00575	We have to look beyond the very short term.
00576	I expect a rapid response.
00577	That is very hard, alone.
00578	The motive for the shooting was not known.
00579	In time, the First Minister will grow in stature.
00580	I could not do it.
00581	The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow.
00582	There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement.
00583	They have to come up with a solution.
00584	We will pay their bills.
00585	Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.
00586	He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture.
00587	I have proved that in the past.
00588	He had been a singer.
00589	They would now be able to look forward with confidence.
00590	Then followed a bout of flu.
00591	Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator.
00592	Even the one she loved.
00593	After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction.
00594	There may be reasons for it.
00595	I first met him last summer.
00596	Last week, he was taken into hospital.
00597	Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games.
00598	Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat.
00599	By then, he was walking on water.
00600	We have to offer value for money.
00601	They lived for their children.
00602	Potions said he would drive.
00603	The latter is due to be finished in February.
00604	This is a complex and detailed report.
00605	The outsourcing deal will take effect in September.
00606	We will deal with the refugees.
00607	You might not make it.
00608	It is open season on the Old Firm.
00609	That is the important thing.
00610	For once, you should believe the hype.
00611	Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons.
00612	Their attitude is all wrong.
00613	You are like an animal.
00614	No, the equipment is extra.
00615	The following are the principal provisions.
00616	It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials.
00617	While they went on holiday, we got the contract.
00618	I had a fortunate war.
00619	I did not see any reason to change the captain.
00620	Saddam Hussein is a devil.
00621	It was never a starter.
00622	And the match was not too bad, either.
00623	Such actions are rarely popular.
00624	It is safe in our hands.
00625	Then came the farewell to Europe.
00626	It is much as it has been described.
00627	You can spend money on housing.
00628	That admission is not surprising.
00629	Not a great deal has changed in the last decade.
00630	It has removed a bit of guilt.
00631	However, we have to be cautious.
00632	But we could only help a handful of people.
00633	This should begin in October.
00634	My life has changed a lot.
00635	We did what we had to do.
00636	Why do it otherwise?
00637	So what is the campaign about?
00638	And does it?
00639	You've got to be vigilant.
00640	We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak.
00641	Any success would have been an improvement.
00642	And I have some advice for my old friend.
00643	He is a great addition to our team.
00644	However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site.
00645	I felt he was excellent.
00646	They could use a boost.
00647	It is a vicious circle.
00648	We could easily have lost that game.
00649	This is a limited market.
00650	Our position is quite simple.
00651	Five minutes later, the home team were back in front.
00652	Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes.
00653	He's not a Celtic man.
00654	It opens the door to the Champions League.
00655	So I got a blood test.
00656	It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment.
00657	These men are a part of India.
00658	Like the others, he was arrested.
00659	There's only one team in Ayrshire.
00660	That was the difference between the sides.
00661	Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
00662	I was shaking on the blocks.
00663	She had gone to the Catholic school.
00664	This year, this month, will be special for Torrance.
00665	The strong pound also took its toll.
00666	It was a funny feeling.
00667	I'd love to be like Peter.
00668	Adams is surely worth a chance.
00669	It is difficult to say.
00670	He was in great spirits.
00671	Seven people were later detained by police.
00672	They want to see him.
00673	Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo.
00674	There is no signature on this document.
00675	We've made a couple of albums.
00676	What happened in that game?
00677	Are you going to win?
00678	Was it the wife?
00679	What do we want to do that for?
00680	The people are the hero.
00681	One season, they might do well.
00682	The second aspect was the fear of failure.
00683	The jury is still out.
00684	But he has a lifeline.
00685	The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
00686	I'm just going to hit the shot.
00687	It makes no influence on the public.
00688	That will apply to both sets of fans.
00689	I think it's a good sign.
00690	I have spoken to head office.
00691	They bought the property four years ago.
00692	He is believed to live in Britain.
00693	We've just had it confirmed.
00694	A copy of the report will be sent to them.
00695	This is the time to use it.
00696	You know the sort of thing.
00697	They were seriously after him.
00698	It was only later that the condition was diagnosed.
00699	Trading conditions have not been that bad.
00700	I'm interested in interesting work.
00701	It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow.
00702	The force is with them.
00703	If the director is with you.
00704	He made no order on costs.
00705	I guess I was lucky, though.
00706	This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds.
00707	It was served by sheriff officers.
00708	This will be our new beginning.
00709	My heart is with the artist.
00710	That might mean another delay.
00711	However, it is not as simple as this.
00712	The sanctions are about collective punishment.
00713	This is a holy place.
00714	How do you get it back?
00715	What are you not good at?
00716	You have caught a serial killer.
00717	It seemed a moving and fitting tribute.
00718	The move follows a review of the Singapore
00719	They make a selective perception process.
00720	There is no quick fix.
00721	They have known the hard times.
00722	I'm just a regular person.
00723	My daughter is an adult.
00724	It's just a normal life.
00725	He must get to know himself.
00726	And the World Cup has not even begun.
00727	He remains a main board director of Royal.
00728	The fight is under way.
00729	They all made the European Ryder Cup team.
00730	We can certainly build on this.
00731	William Hague delighted his party.
00732	There is a world of difference.
00733	We played them off the pitch.
00734	If it doesn't, it doesn't.
00735	I can't wait to meet him.
00736	They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house.
00737	It is the voice of the survivors.
00738	She died in middle age.
00739	You will have seen the adverts.
00740	It is possible to be too good.
00741	Moreover, it must be for all sports.
00742	They were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
00743	Three weeks later, he resigned.
00744	It might be sad, but it's a fact.
00745	She took them for a term.
00746	Kingfisher can afford to wait.
00747	Nato was not a love affair.
00748	Hospitals and school building will go ahead.
00749	You can feel at home in China.
00750	Our decision making was poor.
00751	The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK.
00752	The baby deserves the credit.
00753	Was everything done to save people?
00754	Do I think about them often?
00755	Is it in the right place?
00756	Did he trip?
00757	In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win.
00758	No production contract is yet in sight.
00759	The capital costs are modest.
00760	This is no reflection on Rangers.
00761	I told you I was ill.
00762	I can't get a job.
00763	That could be in place by next year.
00764	On the contrary they stand to gain.
00765	I rejected the idea of a separate residence.
00766	It does not work that way in Scottish football.
00767	Every one is a winner.
00768	There's not much money in cycling.
00769	Not many companies can say that these days.
00770	They can leave at any time.
00771	As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment.
00772	It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight.
00773	It was an easy decision to come here.
00774	Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years.
00775	He ran into immediate problems with local people and police.
00776	But the plot is not the point.
00777	It was never a free kick.
00778	My body is a wreck.
00779	It's called the Supreme Court for a reason.
00780	She has fallen in love with Scotland, however.
00781	She failed in her action.
00782	Stephen will get his first cap.
00783	It's hard to see it.
00784	Her appeal is to be heard this week.
00785	We have to be very, very careful.
00786	The partnership was set up during the summer.
00787	There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast.
00788	It is an amazing response.
00789	Size is not the issue.
00790	He will address the nation this evening.
00791	We have the easy part.
00792	We are not increasing the number.
00793	I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland.
00794	They do not reflect the quality of the brand.
00795	It could well be military.
00796	And that culture is everywhere in Dublin.
00797	His job was not advertised.
00798	This is a big step up.
00799	In that case, the children were not missing.
00800	I have got a victim.
00801	The judge was really nice.
00802	McNaughton was not so sure.
00803	The dealer is on notice.
00804	It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer.
00805	The party lasted all night.
00806	He would help me with the form.
00807	I'm not worried about the critics.
00808	I would do away with the dress code.
00809	It is so easy to be negative.
00810	What form did that take?
00811	Is there a waiting list?
00812	So what happens next?
00813	The result was a crisis for the global financial system.
00814	I am not obsessed with sex.
00815	Have a look at this lot.
00816	That decision will be made over the next couple of days.
00817	Public opinion was split on the proposal.
00818	The king is delighted by the honour.
00819	I've got a sense of humour, too.
00820	In the old days, it was easy.
00821	This is a trend which will be encouraged.
00822	There will have to be a full inquiry.
00823	There was no time scale.
00824	In his absence, the council adopted the change.
00825	Whether this return was too soon.
00826	The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable.
00827	They were the acts of men.
00828	Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items.
00829	Of course, we want to go home.
00830	I am very interested in the subject.
00831	He is not very big, either.
00832	A report is expected next month.
00833	We are encouraged by the news.
00834	Had this been common practice?
00835	What do they want us to do?
00836	Is it worth it?
00837	A crucial moment has arrived.
00838	Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side.
00839	We need to be prepared.
00840	Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground.
00841	His views are hardly surprising.
00842	The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper.
00843	It has been made to entertain.
00844	It is a stroke of genius.
00845	Italy was just behind the US.
00846	It was forced to divert.
00847	Alex Ferguson is the same.
00848	I would like to focus on a structure and a target.
00849	We are still getting over it.
00850	This will impact on us.
00851	From our point of view, the player is free to leave.
00852	The salary changes are long overdue.
00853	I do not like to lose.
00854	I am a member of the Labour Party staff.
00855	There is no deal as yet.
00856	In due course the deal was done.
00857	Celtic were pleased to help.
00858	They will fight for everything.
00859	That's not like us at all.
00860	You have to rely on each other.
00861	I wanted to go out on a high.
00862	I felt the head was very like me.
00863	It is a terrible equation.
00864	They have not got anyone.
00865	Persuaded to change his mind.
00866	It's nice to hear.
00867	So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic.
00868	There's a story, too.
00869	Life was like a timetable.
00870	He took me on a tour of the wards.
00871	We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude.
00872	However, they continued in their pursuit of victory.
00873	In both cases, I suffered a fiasco.
00874	The problem is the pitch.
00875	Indeed, he does.
00876	She is believed to be in South Africa.
00877	My whole life has changed.
00878	On this showing, they should stick with the lads.
00879	No meaningful response was issued.
00880	It is urgent.
00881	Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion.
00882	We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there.
00883	The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures.
00884	Hopefully, it will be built by next year.
00885	Mary Archer is almost too clever.
00886	Here's a clue.
00887	It had been in place since last July.
00888	That's the day job.
00889	For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray.
00890	That's the truth.
00891	He will now seek to sell his shares in the club.
00892	They're appalled by that.
00893	There was a battle there.
00894	It's that kind of place.
00895	Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London.
00896	An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year.
00897	And if he hadn't become a musician?
00898	He is a young man with a new deal.
00899	Charles Kennedy had an effective outing.
00900	Try to save us.
00901	Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
00902	They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide.
00903	It's all I can do.
00904	They do not work for Glasgow City Council.
00905	Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision.
00906	I had my suspicions.
00907	People must remain vigilant.
00908	Today she has been released.
00909	That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog.
00910	He liked to give the impression of being a hard man.
00911	But she might be.
00912	Nothing is yet confirmed.
00913	Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished.
00914	It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats.
00915	Now the system is right behind us.
00916	Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile.
00917	Today I couldn't run on it.
00918	This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit.
00919	Safety was also an issue.
00920	It is an old family habit.
00921	I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party.
00922	The oil companies would be asked to contribute.
00923	It is annoying.
00924	I love the Dome.
00925	We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football.
00926	I wish I had put on a brighter tie.
00927	Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights.
00928	Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults.
00929	It is a good day for the coalition.
00930	A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury.
00931	We're not seeing an image of the person, he said.
00932	Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill.
00933	We have an election in eight days.
00934	For these people, the ruling is very welcome.
00935	They will want to perform well.
00936	However, they will only be found in the wild.
00937	Further protests are likely.
00938	It's in his blood.
00939	I don't want to use the term.
00940	The picture is the same across Scotland.
00941	Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals.
00942	It is so sad.
00943	It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option.
00944	Until the weekend he was minister for social justice.
00945	Who would be a referee?
00946	They've got to account for it.
00947	An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks.
00948	Here, again, they were denied a voice.
00949	It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged.
00950	This plan is an agenda for action.
00951	Despite the result, it was still a great moment.
00952	Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince.
00953	Offered the gold medal, he declined.
00954	Who will attend?
00955	We had a reunion last week.
00956	Ms McNeill was killed on impact.
00957	We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties.
00958	I was the last man to touch the ball.
00959	He was in a great deal of pain.
00960	Nobody in the world can get away from him.
00961	Wallace was a prisoner of war.
00962	I think he's the favourite, no question.
00963	Who would be right?
00964	It is difficult for Ali.
00965	Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition.
00966	Had she enjoyed the experience?
00967	That should do it.
00968	It is not just about pay.
00969	I am just trying to do my job.
00970	The home side didn't stand a chance.
00971	The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous.
00972	The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday.
00973	There's a sense of excess in the novel.
00974	We also enjoyed a lot of support.
00975	It was by the numbers.
00976	I was in daily contact.
00977	Alex has been a huge influence on the club.
00978	It was so new, so exciting.
00979	I've put my own money into this project.
00980	Eight months later, he was dead.
00981	By then, however, both men were already in the US.
00982	We have to sort it out ourselves.
00983	The post will be unpaid.
00984	As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead.
00985	And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers.
00986	They might be broken, but they are not defeated.
00987	Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling.
00988	However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service.
00989	It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned.
00990	The hotel was now for sale.
00991	I drove the ball well.
00992	We knew nothing about it.
00993	They will run a mile.
00994	Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe.
00995	Miller was every bit as happy.
00996	I put the drawing down.
00997	The most important thing is to get a programme for government.
00998	It was an odd affair, in many respects.
00999	Florida is the pivotal state in the nation.
01000	We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
01001	We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner.
01002	The procedure is the same in all cases.
01003	But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections.
01004	I wanted to put myself on the line.
01005	It's the same old story.
01006	I have a cold.
01007	Ferguson should take note.
01008	Who will pay for this?
01009	They've got three-quarters of the way.
01010	He had suffered a heart attack.
01011	A deadline is still essential.
01012	Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man.
01013	We will give a formal response to the report in due course.
01014	After that time, the market itself will set the prices.
01015	That will be vital.
01016	Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement.
01017	That is an important part of our role.
01018	She should not be blamed.
01019	I had decided to quit the show.
01020	It's been a good year.
01021	The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers.
01022	Women were mostly notable by their absence.
01023	The loss of a company to the industry is a blow.
01024	Clearly, the stakes are high.
01025	It is a gamble.
01026	It's so special.
01027	You take a risk.
01028	He is severe.
01029	We were a load of rubbish.
01030	On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence.
01031	The perception is that we do not care about social issues.
01032	I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay.
01033	He claimed the government had lost the plot.
01034	She was well balanced.
01035	He says that he is no different from any other man.
01036	In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify.
01037	It is a policy which has the full support of the minister.
01038	Washington is consumed by the crisis.
01039	He's a lovely young man.
01040	It was a hit.
01041	He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic.
01042	He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather.
01043	It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit.
01044	One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning.
01045	Is that a serious question?
01046	They are real.
01047	They must play for each other.
01048	I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean.
01049	He thought he had a month to cross the street.
01050	Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday.
01051	Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races.
01052	Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public.
01053	I was rubbish.
01054	He's been here on numerous occasions.
01055	Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry.
01056	The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline.
01057	They were too hard.
01058	All options are open.
01059	We want to see the maximum of change.
01060	Mr Campbell received a phone call.
01061	He was obviously very genuine.
01062	She said she could not believe that they had run away.
01063	It changed my life.
01064	The songs are just so good.
01065	I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission.
01066	Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen.
01067	The home was now under new management.
01068	Graeme was prepared.
01069	He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters.
01070	They are wrong.
01071	You are the glory.
01072	It's certainly different.
01073	A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe.
01074	We want to play at the worlds.
01075	We have waited a long time for this.
01076	Is there on his hands?
01077	This wasn't the way it was supposed to be.
01078	It's not even finished.
01079	The problems began a long time ago.
01080	This film will be totally awesome.
01081	There was some merit in that.
01082	It's not long enough.
01083	Is that an issue?
01084	My first concern is for the safety of the public.
01085	Robert is a special talent.
01086	A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry.
01087	You have to be able to deal with all age groups.
01088	The same things will happen with GM foods.
01089	It has moved on in the last week.
01090	The train was on time.
01091	It is so unfair.
01092	He has to learn.
01093	I've got no secret.
01094	Tiger is the exception.
01095	A great deal has been achieved.
01096	In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre.
01097	This is a friendly match?
01098	I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil.
01099	He's a genius.
01100	They should take their mobile phones.
01101	It is not like working for a living.
01102	It's the last thing on my mind.
01103	The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police.
01104	He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal.
01105	Everyone was in tears.
01106	As, indeed, they would be.
01107	I expected these kind of questions.
01108	It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives.
01109	He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer.
01110	He later became a respected High Court judge.
01111	The play is based on a real-life event.
01112	We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy.
01113	The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland.
01114	He put some colour into Scottish history.
01115	It took about an hour for the gas to clear.
01116	I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself.
01117	It is a simple equation.
01118	So there, we won.
01119	But I managed.
01120	By that time, however, it was already too late.
01121	There is no signature.
01122	It's a record label, not a form of music.
01123	It became a national network.
01124	Johnson was pretty low.
01125	He said the matter had been neglected in the past.
01126	Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format.
01127	I have a theory.
01128	It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract.
01129	And we have a singer.
01130	A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes.
01131	It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does.
01132	I'd like to continue that record.
01133	They're just different.
01134	Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack.
01135	He did not know his daughter.
01136	I was scared.
01137	It will come all right.
01138	But it took a lot of bottle.
01139	But it is all by design.
01140	I am just going to go for it.
01141	The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids.
01142	A recording contract is on the horizon.
01143	We've got a lot of respect for the Lions.
01144	She's a spy !
01145	What was the main difference?
01146	My mother is a widow.
01147	And a film maker was born.
01148	We should have known.
01149	It is like a river running by my home.
01150	That was the easy election.
01151	I was as strong as a horse.
01152	The girls are so lucky to be alive.
01153	She died in hospital two hours later.
01154	It was chaotic.
01155	I've not thought about it.
01156	Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time.
01157	Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits.
01158	Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night.
01159	Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money.
01160	He can do everything.
01161	Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives.
01162	It is a lifeline.
01163	We must look forward.
01164	Well, the big day has arrived.
01165	Until you hit the big games.
01166	The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic.
01167	She has so much to offer.
01168	The court heard he drove into the path of a car.
01169	We work on the same level.
01170	Two of the team became ill.
01171	I didn't play well last year.
01172	I'm not depressed.
01173	He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald.
01174	He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter.
01175	I came to complete.
01176	I was angry.
01177	They were behind the wheel.
01178	The fire was above the hole.
01179	It's not fair.
01180	We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail.
01181	I'm delighted about that.
01182	I joined a group.
01183	It is rubbish.
01184	It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief.
01185	There will be no shortage of quality applicants.
01186	Next season for every manager is a long time away.
01187	It's an amazing landscape !
01188	So the European elections are extremely important.
01189	He is slightly confused.
01190	If not, a deal could take many months.
01191	They took a risk.
01192	What will happen then?
01193	We never said that we would walk through the third division.
01194	We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football.
01195	He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative.
01196	He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context.
01197	Crucially, though, United were still alive.
01198	It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse.
01199	I knew he was good.
01200	He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused.
01201	Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes.
01202	Was this element always there?
01203	A new season has offered a fresh start for both men.
01204	I will tell you.
01205	A Labour insider said it was far too close to call.
01206	It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened.
01207	Military action is the only option we have on the table today.
01208	It's that sort of night.
01209	Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland.
01210	It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful.
01211	It is a memorial.
01212	It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate.
01213	They thought they had found a home.
01214	Is Saddam a threat?
01215	He asked me in a tolerance zone.
01216	It is minute.
01217	Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted.
01218	Four policemen were wounded.
01219	What has caused the demise of singing?
01220	I've got good news and bad news for you.
01221	Last night was a key episode.
01222	Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament.
01223	It wasn't to be.
01224	I came home by ambulance.
01225	But we are not immune to the problem.
01226	He has a lot of experience as captain in his career.
01227	The sisters also became the top two players in the world.
01228	The procedures were not in place.
01229	It was worth a photograph.
01230	We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence.
01231	The FBI could become involved.
01232	However, Dundee deserved to win this game.
01233	On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football.
01234	The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument.
01235	Who was on the panel?
01236	We've got the bronze.
01237	Saturday is gone.
01238	The boy is no longer with us.
01239	I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision.
01240	You should always be able to get out in some direction.
01241	We are so proud.
01242	It's an idea.
01243	The problem in Norway is outside the National.
01244	The letters are going out today.
01245	Chambers said he would accept the place.
01246	Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries.
01247	It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak.
01248	This year I understood.
01249	Kirkwood was arrested.
01250	This is a big club.
01251	I was happily surprised.
01252	The pensioners did not want to know.
01253	That is highly unfair.
01254	Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention.
01255	He was also married with two children.
01256	We're in shock.
01257	Our objective is to tackle poverty.
01258	He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry.
01259	I am an estate agent.
01260	People have no choice.
01261	They were on holiday in Egypt.
01262	It was a privilege to work for him.
01263	In fact, he was talking about the survival business.
01264	If not, he should go home.
01265	I saw it at a ruck.
01266	I felt like I was a child.
01267	What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
01268	The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible.
01269	We have other options.
01270	It shows a contempt by him for the industry.
01271	These figures are truly awful.
01272	Sunday's game was not a trial.
01273	Disruption will be kept to a minimum.
01274	I was brought up in a mining background.
01275	The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office.
01276	There is no openness.
01277	It's just not funny !
01278	The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn.
01279	However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart.
01280	Let's hope it's an investment in the future.
01281	O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place.
01282	This is the culture change in medicine.
01283	It should be equal.
01284	Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans.
01285	We are very strongly behind the bid.
01286	It could have gone either way.
01287	She did not attend the courtroom.
01288	It is difficult to get into the team at the moment.
01289	He told the court.
01290	The team for the first game could be this one.
01291	They haven't got a hope.
01292	Gaelic provision continued to be good.
01293	He did a good job.
01294	Indeed, it was magical.
01295	The visual arts committee took this decision in December.
01296	I'm very lucky.
01297	They may yet have the last laugh.
01298	Everything was an effort.
01299	Like his acting, it was an accident.
01300	It is long gone.
01301	Tell us about it.
01302	There is a cup final at stake.
01303	It was very formal.
01304	In addition, it was in breach of natural justice.
01305	It benefits the whole family.
01306	It was fit for royalty.
01307	We are looking for perfection.
01308	The group is due to publish its report in the autumn.
01309	I am a star.
01310	We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors.
01311	He could make it.
01312	For one veteran, the memories remain vivid.
01313	It is not too late to get on board.
01314	Talks are progressing.
01315	They play together perfectly.
01316	It's a long process.
01317	Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter.
01318	It does not even have a staff shortage.
01319	However, the players should have a voice in these matters.
01320	It is obvious that we are engaged in a war.
01321	That team is due to be announced this morning.
01322	It has been a lovely family occasion.
01323	That's the name of the game, though.
01324	There were no casualties.
01325	A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting.
01326	Yet the data is compelling.
01327	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky.
01328	Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
01329	It is on the internet.
01330	Smoking is also very important.
01331	He has the courage of the unaware.
01332	I'm so happy that she did.
01333	The wedding was in Edinburgh.
01334	He really is a lovely man.
01335	The staff are as good as any staff in the city.
01336	They said she was stable.
01337	This will save interest charges.
01338	Well, he is an artist.
01339	People want to see me on the screen.
01340	The big problem is the lack of grass.
01341	That was the theory, anyway.
01342	I was inspired by two things.
01343	I must take a seat.
01344	It was bound to happen.
01345	We have to bring in new players.
01346	None has ever been found.
01347	We should be able to cope.
01348	You should consider whether you want to be in this film.
01349	It was exactly four months away.
01350	It's not covered by the insurance.
01351	But the challenge is in the US.
01352	Robin Williams is very subdued.
01353	The tournament has now been cancelled.
01354	He also received a medal of honour.
01355	It may be that lifestyle is behind it.
01356	It looks like a hit.
01357	However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made.
01358	Consumer confidence remains an issue.
01359	This is a true story.
01360	It's so hard to shift.
01361	It might change your life.
01362	It was not an insult.
01363	However, a decision should be made before the end of August.
01364	The conclusion is the same.
01365	He was prepared for this.
01366	But I know the course.
01367	We intend to change the model.
01368	It has been a nightmare of frustration.
01369	But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant.
01370	This was a good move for me.
01371	I was just appalled at the way they behaved.
01372	It is close to call.
01373	It is an impressive record.
01374	It is a total and utter change of culture.
01375	Abbey National is an option.
01376	The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem.
01377	We have the mental strength.
01378	I can't even get into the A team.
01379	Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership.
01380	Which can happen any time.
01381	It is too pretty, it is too small.
01382	But this time we can have no excuses.
01383	They are very happy with the new settlement.
01384	The abuse of elderly people was appalling.
01385	Something will be done by corporate bodies.
01386	She was also very brave.
01387	We must recognise that this outfit is unique.
01388	The opposite is the case.
01389	This is a successful outcome.
01390	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray.
01391	She died at her home.
01392	It was a piece of art.
01393	I would relish the prospect.
01394	I was caught out a little bit.
01395	I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
01396	It has to be an event.
01397	The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done.
01398	She has gone to the Catholic school.
01399	I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that.
01400	However, he was later released without charge.
01401	This might seem like an outrageous assertion.
01402	I'm afraid to say anything.
01403	It has to be now.
01404	You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues.
01405	You had to go and see him.
01406	Are you from the rugby?
01407	Had I heard?
01408	Our position remains the same.
01409	We believe in the medium term.
01410	It's nice to be nice.
01411	To get good people, you need to offer them enough money.
01412	On the month the weakness was across the board.
01413	Manchester United can win the European Cup this season.
01414	First and foremost, the game is entirely different.
01415	Phase one was a shambles.
01416	City sentiment is in his favour.
01417	I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal.
01418	At the top level, the salaries are far too high.
01419	Tomorrow is a new day.
01420	She has left the island.
01421	He played it like a veteran.
01422	It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area.
01423	Our destiny is in our own hands.
01424	He prefers to play for them.
01425	He lives in a neighbouring village.
01426	We represent a wide range of society.
01427	We always felt we could win.
01428	It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however.
01429	Neither side would reveal the details of the offer.
01430	I made a terrible start.
01431	The result is called a patent.
01432	Racism has no place in any sport.
01433	We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead.
01434	This will take several weeks.
01435	The research is published in the journal, Nature.
01436	Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match.
01437	All will be revealed in due course.
01438	The most exciting room is the final one of the show.
01439	He has made his base in Spain.
01440	My life is in the ballet.
01441	Basically, they have to come up with the offer.
01442	His second was a beauty.
01443	The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday.
01444	It was a day for records.
01445	That has been the easy part.
01446	Things were so intense in the studio.
01447	I was not sure whether I had won.
01448	So far, the problems have occurred in the US.
01449	It had so much to do with output.
01450	Must have been at the bar.
01451	No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden.
01452	They need to win a trophy.
01453	Half the young people had had contact with the police.
01454	In many ways, that is as important.
01455	Here is a question for you.
01456	I was just a kid.
01457	Sadly, it sounds as if it is.
01458	Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter.
01459	We have to compete at our own level.
01460	They showed a lot of heart.
01461	This gives a financial incentive to switch.
01462	Defensive stocks attracted some interest.
01463	In fact, we were all over the shop.
01464	Either way, the investor retains the premium.
01465	Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape.
01466	Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me.
01467	I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board.
01468	I was ready for this.
01469	They are interior designers and architects.
01470	We feel very good about it.
01471	It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner.
01472	It is also very valuable.
01473	None of this work is guaranteed.
01474	There is a case to answer.
01475	We're trying to get rounded performers.
01476	That was a gold medal for certain.
01477	Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt.
01478	In that moment, I was happy.
01479	The actor has met with Mandela.
01480	It is a recipe for success.
01481	I would rather look at him.
01482	It's got to come from me.
01483	It took a month and a half to film.
01484	The cause of the accident remained unclear.
01485	It is a symbolic concert.
01486	He is at war with his knee.
01487	Again the parallel with football can be drawn.
01488	I was there five months ago.
01489	You have to see it like this.
01490	Rugby is now just like football.
01491	There is an element of racism in Scotland.
01492	And we can do it.
01493	The casting is as perfect.
01494	Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear.
01495	They are not left wing.
01496	It is a road of death.
01497	The group is not paying a dividend.
01498	We were on our way.
01499	That meant the search was unlawful.
01500	We are on a four-year mission.
01501	This is a historic occasion.
01502	This ruling is a farce.
01503	I can see their argument.
01504	After some discussion they did.
01505	It was always an option.
01506	Did it work?
01507	Do you think we are a top nation?
01508	The election is total confusion and chaos.
01509	You may have a short memory.
01510	That is a trend which will be encouraged.
01511	We think all other measures are not exhausted.
01512	Last night, he pledged to clear his name.
01513	I have a moral dilemma.
01514	You have no chance of planning permission.
01515	In addition, certain areas closed at certain times.
01516	The professor said the results were positive.
01517	In fact, it is deeply unpleasant.
01518	I am a lucky man.
01519	Nobody else was with me.
01520	We put our bid in last night.
01521	George Mitchell is trying to close the gap.
01522	But BA said the prediction was premature.
01523	They have broken the promise.
01524	We are really good friends.
01525	My goal is quite simple.
01526	This is a major championship.
01527	It's going to be fun.
01528	She is now on the back benches.
01529	Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited.
01530	This hasn't happened in a vacuum.
01531	Both of those promises have already been honoured.
01532	We are a Scottish company.
01533	We will win the argument.
01534	Tomorrow will be a different game entirely.
01535	It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage.
01536	I always knew she was funny.
01537	He is a close friend of Gordon Brown.
01538	The marshall at the turn was great.
01539	If you can get it.
01540	On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options.
01541	There was a substantial explosion.
01542	The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account.
01543	He could face a jail sentence.
01544	That is the consistent approach of the Government.
01545	This big issue is whether it can be enforced.
01546	Clark is back on top form.
01547	Motion described it as a unique event.
01548	That investment has now been secured.
01549	It is a large number.
01550	You will not feel a thing.
01551	I've never seen a game like it.
01552	It was a bank holiday, after all.
01553	We're obviously disturbed by this case.
01554	The casualties were not named.
01555	It is a temptation which should be resisted.
01556	It had been on the cards.
01557	The second goal was superb.
01558	Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope.
01559	It is the old story.
01560	This should put downward pressure on inflation.
01561	No date has been set for a meeting.
01562	We have to build a new team in the minimum of time.
01563	On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value.
01564	I'd just like to play.
01565	There was a rush of water.
01566	Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted.
01567	That deal is a joke.
01568	If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it.
01569	It carried a double message.
01570	That means an extra two years.
01571	But he can turn on the charm.
01572	You must always attempt to raise the bar.
01573	The man became a reporter.
01574	Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen.
01575	Last year, I was pretty bad.
01576	He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted.
01577	A win is a win.
01578	There's nothing we could do about this.
01579	We keep an eye on it.
01580	We have not given up hope.
01581	The cuts were made within an hour of each other.
01582	She said she was really sorry.
01583	Italy is a beautiful place.
01584	It was a lovely experience.
01585	Only water is currently allowed.
01586	We need to increase the membership.
01587	This is an exciting new venture.
01588	He highlighted a lack of staff.
01589	Both men were on one-year contracts.
01590	That would be too easy.
01591	Both agreed on the success of the event.
01592	On Saturday, it was much the same.
01593	Strathclyde Police declined to comment.
01594	He's been hit by it.
01595	I saw the whole thing.
01596	We must stop it with the golf ball.
01597	This is the logic of punishment assaults.
01598	We should recognise others have done a good job.
01599	It's not a quick fix.
01600	We needed financial backing to get it off the ground.
01601	New Year will be very busy.
01602	There's still plenty time left.
01603	It proved a good decision.
01604	January is a bad time of year.
01605	I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar.
01606	Then again, we could have.
01607	There were no grounds for his action.
01608	I was just a child.
01609	We should not be surprised.
01610	It was not a finale he would want to remember.
01611	That period was a struggle.
01612	That is far too high.
01613	It plans to return to this field.
01614	Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll.
01615	You're a gambling man.
01616	Put yourself in the position of being a referee.
01617	I miss the freedom that I had.
01618	It only increased the support for him.
01619	Anyone can do the sums.
01620	It has become a way of life.
01621	The whole industry is a shambles.
01622	It is not normal practice.
01623	The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms.
01624	A new school will be built.
01625	It is a terrible tragedy.
01626	He was right into football from an early age.
01627	It is not like us.
01628	We have a budget in March.
01629	You've been a great audience.
01630	It is simply not true.
01631	Well, this article is a bit like that.
01632	It is really good news.
01633	My life has been destroyed.
01634	I always felt they played for me.
01635	This much I can tell you.
01636	The Hibs manager is no fool.
01637	We are the gateway to justice.
01638	But one was not enough.
01639	I am not ready to walk away.
01640	The shooting created panic in the street.
01641	So many people will be affected by this.
01642	As many as the market will support.
01643	They need to look after themselves.
01644	I suggest a new plan.
01645	It was a moment of madness.
01646	Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon.
01647	Libya is an easy target.
01648	What are you no good at?
01649	It gave no further details.
01650	You've caught a serial killer.
01651	I won't make an official complaint.
01652	We are a new department.
01653	They are looking at flotation.
01654	Which isn't a bad idea.
01655	He also presented You Bet!
01656	He has a lot of skill.
01657	I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery.
01658	The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo.
01659	That you can do it.
01660	This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely.
01661	They are the innocent victims.
01662	I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight.
01663	My future is in the marathon.
01664	It is now the big brother.
01665	The parties have no contact.
01666	He is due in Israel tomorrow.
01667	His is a global perspective.
01668	But they were never expected to last.
01669	It was a cry for help.
01670	Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland.
01671	He admitted that he knew nothing about it.
01672	It seems a shame to leave it.
01673	It was the climax of the thing.
01674	The concerns are the same.
01675	I've had the time of my life.
01676	The property is owned by Glasgow City Council.
01677	I thought he might have been a bit.
01678	This news came after the stock market closed on Monday.
01679	I'd never run for them.
01680	These figures are truly terrible.
01681	Share prices have fallen for three years in a row.
01682	The joint bid is still on course.
01683	At first I thought I was gone.
01684	The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack.
01685	That view has not altered.
01686	Blair also had a penalty.
01687	It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday.
01688	I've lost all confidence.
01689	This could be a mistake.
01690	Once again, they would be wrong.
01691	It's all designed to speed up the service.
01692	They have shown a great desire and attitude.
01693	I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh.
01694	But it is up again.
01695	Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled.
01696	I was just so determined.
01697	You are a different people.
01698	He is still in shock.
01699	I thought he did very well.
01700	I'm not making any comment at all.
01701	We're on our way.
01702	They come to enjoy themselves.
01703	However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals.
01704	We have got no money to go anywhere.
01705	It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register.
01706	I am not sure about the rate of progress.
01707	To beat the European champion is quite nice.
01708	However, the groups denied the claims.
01709	I think it's about time.
01710	At first, the youngster was not keen.
01711	The figures are bad, but not that bad.
01712	Finally came the moment of truth.
01713	The units will not be replaced.
01714	Neither man has been charged.
01715	Look at the Liberal Democrats.
01716	But they have taken the lesson to heart.
01717	I've always been a sensitive.
01718	Glasgow is a friendly city.
01719	We live on an island.
01720	It is not real life.
01721	Neither woman has been named.
01722	You need a licence to run a pub.
01723	We regret that they're brought in the first place.
01724	Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months.
01725	But we finished the show.
01726	They were to blame for the first two goals.
01727	Here is a weather forecast for the weekend.
01728	We were given a break.
01729	to have products for their needs.
01730	The pair are very much in love.
01731	Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors.
01732	That time may never be broken.
01733	The response from them was good.
01734	But we are very near.
01735	That's as good as it gets.
01736	A review is under way.
01737	They have failed to deliver.
01738	She is in their hands.
01739	It is hard to understand.
01740	There was an element of frustration.
01741	I will always remember the horrible images.
01742	They are looking for profit.
01743	I remain a buyer of the shares.
01744	There is some light in the tunnel.
01745	He liked the weather, the courses, the food.
01746	The case will now go to appeal.
01747	There is a solution, she believes.
01748	It was important to win the singles.
01749	The road was closed for several hours.
01750	My aim is a top six finish.
01751	I would love to think that she could win.
01752	Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime.
01753	He is on the wrong side.
01754	It was a breathtaking moment.
01755	I was in jail for five years.
01756	I never had a childhood.
01757	It is based on a true story.
01758	But it can be done.
01759	I never won a penny throughout my career.
01760	There will be no excuses on Wednesday.
01761	The growth potential is enormous.
01762	The British government does not want to know.
01763	They said they were only young men.
01764	We shall not forget him.
01765	They made a huge impression on me.
01766	It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
01767	It sounded like a bomb.
01768	Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey.
01769	We've got a good management record.
01770	Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt.
01771	And we might go back.
01772	We have just got to keep his feet on the ground.
01773	We went straight into the bedroom.
01774	Its future is no longer in question.
01775	Today, he is in the same position as four years ago.
01776	They have to be met.
01777	We think a lot of Allan McGregor.
01778	She has reached the top of her profession.
01779	A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing.
01780	They were good years for him.
01781	Let that be their memorial.
01782	Nine days later, he suffered another attack.
01783	Driving has been the key.
01784	She has now been registered as disabled.
01785	He is well respected by his colleagues.
01786	Classes must be reduced by half.
01787	War is not the action.
01788	However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action.
01789	It is too early to speculate.
01790	Dennis was not so sure.
01791	He felt it was the right time.
01792	It was clear on Thursday.
01793	It was all in a short period of time.
01794	That was the first time I worked with Richard.
01795	But it failed.
01796	They should be so lucky.
01797	Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected.
01798	They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday.
01799	I would love it.
01800	It is marvellous.
01801	But it may take some time to confirm the findings.
01802	Dancing was her life.
01803	I suspect the latter.
01804	We will push.
01805	The judge said.
01806	They had to explain it.
01807	We were surprised to see the photograph.
01808	Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident.
01809	It's very odd.
01810	This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers.
01811	The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine.
01812	The problems are a result of that shortfall.
01813	People love to see this stuff.
01814	We welcome the decision of Mr Byers.
01815	The price cuts are really exciting.
01816	He is now resident in England.
01817	I've got the shirt.
01818	What has changed?
01819	I will miss him.
01820	It's all going to clear the debt.
01821	She had kept the news from him.
01822	No progress has been made.
01823	Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today.
01824	Then came the crunch.
01825	There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee.
01826	That is no use.
01827	He pleaded for caution.
01828	He was jailed for a year.
01829	You had better believe it.
01830	This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad.
01831	That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships.
01832	That's all right then.
01833	I'm so angry.
01834	The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies.
01835	That first victory made a huge difference to my career.
01836	The goals were good.
01837	I am totally devoted to this job.
01838	I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings.
01839	They did very well.
01840	They were later discharged from hospital.
01841	This latter point is hugely important.
01842	Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors.
01843	Tell it like it was?
01844	That must be left to the Parole Board.
01845	Again, we were lucky.
01846	Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final.
01847	Waiting times for these services are too long.
01848	That will do for me.
01849	You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions.
01850	Blair's response was weak.
01851	It's the real thing, for sure.
01852	The clarity is vital.
01853	Everyone can be bought.
01854	Family liaison officers are now working to support the family.
01855	They receive a high profile in the media.
01856	We did everything by the book.
01857	I wish I could say something.
01858	The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address.
01859	The conference is the first test.
01860	He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book.
01861	On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult.
01862	There was an e-mail.
01863	He seemed to lose his focus.
01864	Mental health is a massive issue.
01865	It was good fun.
01866	It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come.
01867	But she was.
01868	We were awful.
01869	However, no further action was taken by police.
01870	And thought we would get away with it.
01871	It's quite nice.
01872	It's quite a line-up!
01873	It's a lovely, lovely film.
01874	The Home Office would not release any further details about the group.
01875	Broke the birdie record.
01876	A change in that position would require a decision by the council.
01877	Jock Brown is appointed as general manager.
01878	I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result.
01879	Some families have even requested to leave the city.
01880	A friendship that will endure.
01881	He said he intended to push for a judicial review.
01882	For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique.
01883	The bottom line is that we had to get a win.
01884	It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor.
01885	However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint.
01886	Blood samples were taken.
01887	They want to shut the Scottish Office.
01888	That review will look at management across the sector as a whole.
01889	Of course, that is not the whole story.
01890	The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision.
01891	Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate.
01892	Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes.
01893	Everything will fall into place, it should be fine.
01894	They wanted the club to make money.
01895	Finally, he paid for the movie.
01896	The record companies have gone through the floor.
01897	Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that.
01898	They were also beside themselves.
01899	The attacker died in the crash.
01900	The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies.
01901	A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident.
01902	He has retired.
01903	What has altered?
01904	Nothing is safe.
01905	We are now looking at the degrees of injury.
01906	He was solid.
01907	Special measures were needed.
01908	I never thought it would take this long.
01909	For the moment, our position remains the same.
01910	Davis is very supportive, as a director.
01911	Off with their heads.
01912	They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden.
01913	We agreed to disagree.
01914	Horses are drawn by ballot.
01915	His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday.
01916	Who will do it?
01917	That's not eviction because he is not a tenant.
01918	Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector.
01919	I could hardly move for the next couple of days.
01920	On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos.
01921	He had played well in that central role.
01922	It's not that clear-cut.
01923	But the real problem is the closure of the export market.
01924	However, it was well worth the wait.
01925	He has seen the past.
01926	It was one in the afternoon.
01927	To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential.
01928	We will be homeless.
01929	The scene is about this?
01930	It was a double tragedy for the family.
01931	They have not done so this season so far.
01932	Five members were disciplined.
01933	I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role.
01934	That left a bad taste in my mouth.
01935	It was as if it was all happening at a garden party.
01936	You thought it was a headache.
01937	Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare.
01938	We're looking for justice.
01939	I can lead by example.
01940	I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title.
01941	But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat.
01942	It will probably take me just days to spend it.
01943	It is legally binding.
01944	My house was shaking at the time.
01945	This is a huge confidence boost.
01946	We have not yet received a letter from the Irish.
01947	He was a crazy man.
01948	Feel the air, the space.
01949	Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling.
01950	I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't.
01951	You wanted the evidence.
01952	Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra.
01953	It was that bad, that low.
01954	I was very young.
01955	We are a service industry.
01956	But we will have to wait.
01957	Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports.
01958	I am not interested in the money, it is the principle.
01959	However, the following year the cancer returned.
01960	Victory was never in doubt.
01961	We are the party of the future.
01962	I have never been a member of the council.
01963	He was in his element.
01964	At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries.
01965	All businesses continue to trade.
01966	It depends on the decisions of the member states.
01967	It is all starting to come together.
01968	Part of the complex is historic.
01969	The strategy is not without risk.
01970	But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded.
01971	I was released after six days.
01972	We are working on it.
01973	I've never been one for complaining about the press.
01974	This trend is likely to strengthen.
01975	Still, he did not let himself down this week.
01976	He looks as if he could be worth the risk.
01977	You have to be patient.
01978	That is all in the past.
01979	That could be a mistake.
01980	It was an amazing result.
01981	Indeed, it is only the beginning.
01982	He has not been dropped.
01983	This time, it might be for real.
01984	She did that for the rest of her life.
01985	Seriously, we are not concerned at all.
01986	It starts with the script.
01987	We were under a bit of pressure.
01988	The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister.
01989	We can all make a mistake.
01990	Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom.
01991	On the night, it was not enough.
01992	It is not long term, but I need time to recover.
01993	However, a ruling will not come before next week.
01994	They were badly prepared for it.
01995	It is not a story.
01996	However, we will obviously keep the matter under review.
01997	They have a further report to make in March.
01998	He is in the US.
01999	The Festival is prepared to help.
02000	I had a bit in hand.
02001	We have to have a full statement to Parliament.
02002	I cannot wait to get started on it.
02003	That is the fact of the matter.
02004	It should be a condition of employment.
02005	Police said the family was helping with the search.
02006	She was there for the start of the campaign.
02007	He has become a monster.
02008	Everyone had to play the game.
02009	In London today, it was business as usual.
02010	It is not affected by the sale.
02011	We are currently working on the details.
02012	According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
02013	It was the eighties.
02014	We do not expect any surplus.
02015	Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw.
02016	It's not a new concept in jazz.
02017	My office is bare.
02018	It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside.
02019	His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years.
02020	It's an amazing landscape!
02021	Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family.
02022	Tenants will be unable to defend themselves.
02023	The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council.
02024	Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg.
02025	I saw some terrible things.
02026	It seems so long since I did the exams.
02027	It is like a football team.
02028	It would be a last resort.
02029	He will emerge as a world leader.
02030	Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe.
02031	The attacker has been put in foster care.
02032	She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers.
02033	Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks.
02034	Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.
02035	The release attracted little attention.
02036	He will feel the pain again.
02037	I feel like my game has come a long way.
02038	There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging.
02039	We are very concerned about controller fatigue.
02040	I was totally wrong.
02041	There is no point in looking any further.
02042	It's a joke.
02043	He may need it.
02044	We need to handle it.
02045	The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn.
02046	I had relied on him.
02047	Work has started.
02048	Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E.
02049	You have to do your research.
02050	The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions.
02051	It's a question of creating a future awareness.
02052	My neighbours are horrified.
02053	But he failed to win the committee's support.
02054	Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight.
02055	The role was a knockout, but really difficult.
02056	A succession of managers in the opera company resigned.
02057	We were extremely poor.
02058	I know I'm in a very special position.
02059	The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery.
02060	There wasn't a goal.
02061	Her presence was almost everywhere.
02062	The distinction is also supported by doctors.
02063	I watched a game.
02064	There will be tough opponents to this report.
02065	It looks as though he will be right.
02066	Immediate action must be taken.
02067	It is the same in Sweden.
02068	And Michael was just great.
02069	However, he will have his work cut out defending his title.
02070	Who can predict?
02071	That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients.
02072	Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday.
02073	They should be swept away.
02074	Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well.
02075	It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure.
02076	I saw some good things.
02077	It added to the spectacle.
02078	Who was the mystery MP?
02079	However, Sharon rejected the claims.
02080	The composer will conduct.
02081	The decision is an absolute disgrace.
02082	Tyson is overwhelmed.
02083	He agreed with my proposal.
02084	Hartley should know.
02085	Also, it is the season of goodwill.
02086	The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season.
02087	They received a reply from their own managers.
02088	Colour was at the core of his life.
02089	We shall not be moved.
02090	He's a nice guy.
02091	Since then, he has played no active part in the company.
02092	Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director.
02093	The mood was defiant.
02094	It's just outrageous.
02095	It is unusual.
02096	The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position.
02097	That set the tone.
02098	What happened in the summer?
02099	The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today.
02100	History is in the making.
02101	It was sold at a loss.
02102	The market is appalling for initial public offerings.
02103	That would be decided at the interim results in November, he added.
02104	That would be a serious problem.
02105	Our action is not the end, but the beginning of a process.
02106	People have been placed in a state of alarm.
02107	She is not a victim.
02108	And we had a good response.
02109	When we looked at the company.
02110	The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time.
02111	There was a lot of resentment.
02112	He wanted to record the group.
02113	However, it was a different story in the final.
02114	The end result is the same.
02115	Three days later, he was killed.
02116	However, the bank denied that he was in the running.
02117	He had no money left to run the club.
02118	It is not so simple.
02119	Actors like to be in the centre.
02120	When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather.
02121	They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed.
02122	In addition, investor choice is reduced.
02123	She does not want to speak.
02124	It is expected to last a week.
02125	Full consent is expected by the end of next year.
02126	But it is different in different regions.
02127	That is the nature of the game.
02128	There is a spring in the step.
02129	We want to get there.
02130	He suffered a broken back and other injuries.
02131	I have a lot of confidence in this team.
02132	The players were under pressure.
02133	Not that the occasion was without restraint.
02134	There is no common ground.
02135	Frankly, it was worth the booking.
02136	At the moment we do not understand it.
02137	So far, the scheme has not been used in Scotland.
02138	It is not about the money, it is about everything.
02139	Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks.
02140	Much of the equipment was new.
02141	I have had a good life.
02142	They have not been named.
02143	I was in a hole.
02144	It is ambitious, but it can be achieved.
02145	I was always in control.
02146	There remains an outstanding damages action against the former.
02147	They were not seeking the right to strike.
02148	He called for a public inquiry.
02149	Tony Blair has had a good conference.
02150	In light of things, I think I made the right decision.
02151	It is not in the public interest.
02152	The performance is not there.
02153	It would make a lot of sense.
02154	Clearly, they had other problems.
02155	He has defended the system.
02156	I could not sit in the stands.
02157	They have to get that sorted.
02158	Yet the performance was not entirely convincing.
02159	We can take the city.
02160	I will be in Scotland.
02161	It was the story of the second half.
02162	The trading conditions are not good.
02163	Equally, he is grateful to have survived the cull.
02164	This is an interesting link.
02165	It was a management problem in the hospital.
02166	Being investor ready is a good start.
02167	Last night, the company could not be contacted.
02168	This conference was never confirmed.
02169	However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu.
02170	He must have a crack at it.
02171	Her experience is certainly limited.
02172	The deal is expected to be completed by September.
02173	However, he said the money had not been wasted.
02174	Mr Blair was ready for him.
02175	We are waiting for the Minister to come back with an answer.
02176	He intends to restart in the spring.
02177	He is a good friend.
02178	It is the strength of the school.
02179	But it may not be all bad news.
02180	I was not overly concerned about this.
02181	You can buy them over the counter, anywhere.
02182	It was far from business as usual.
02183	It was just another play.
02184	From there, they can go anywhere.
02185	The world is a good place.
02186	This is a sensible and common sense approach.
02187	The matter is under appeal.
02188	I am delighted for them.
02189	It was a great experience.
02190	They are difficult awards to decide.
02191	Anyway, the job will be part-time.
02192	Scotland played a major part in the project.
02193	Investors were also concerned about margin pressure.
02194	Not in this production he doesn't.
02195	Then was the summer of their discontent.
02196	Well, it was certainly different.
02197	We want this place to work.
02198	The statement contained no surprises.
02199	The performance continues to improve.
02200	That would be a danger.
02201	It depends on Labour, not on us.
02202	I had to be into it.
02203	My view has always been the same.
02204	Do you think we're a top nation?
02205	Is our children learning?
02206	How independent is that?
02207	The party has never fully recovered.
02208	His leader wanted to celebrate.
02209	Of further privacy, he had no need.
02210	He was good, but not that good.
02211	The results are expected within days.
02212	The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said.
02213	Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise.
02214	We were well worth the win.
02215	And it was this one.
02216	But that's another story for another day.
02217	But it was also hard.
02218	If so, it is a funny time to introduce it.
02219	We're looking for unity in the council.
02220	By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started.
02221	They are not going the length of the pitch.
02222	However, he lasted only five days before going on the run.
02223	Scotland won by six wickets.
02224	It has to be enforced.
02225	Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis.
02226	They have set the standard.
02227	This is a major property in Edinburgh.
02228	It is a crisis of human rights, a crisis of leadership.
02229	The existing structure is in trouble.
02230	It all started with a visiting rugby club.
02231	He refused to reveal the reasons for the split.
02232	You have to count on other people.
02233	And he's the real thing.
02234	But it is important for a number of reasons.
02235	All of the management has invested in the firm.
02236	The family is not interested in the value of the house.
02237	Hopefully, this week will be good.
02238	I think the overall picture is still strong.
02239	That is always a problem.
02240	We will deliver at director level.
02241	We did something about it.
02242	The market is the market.
02243	We do not have the papers.
02244	However, the devil is in the detail.
02245	For the moment, however, the position is clear.
02246	The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted.
02247	The answer was in space.
02248	We are not interested in dividends.
02249	Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence.
02250	His concern is only for the future.
02251	And it's a goodbye from him.
02252	They have to be addressed.
02253	However, a bid was never made.
02254	That is the lesson of the last three weeks.
02255	The City welcomed the numbers.
02256	Something is going to have to give.
02257	We never played at all.
02258	A shortlist is to be drawn up next month.
02259	It's going to have a hell of an effect.
02260	He was jailed for four years.
02261	He should emerge as the winner.
02262	He works at the airport.
02263	That was the case with David.
02264	I needed a change, a new challenge.
02265	Their campaign is in disarray.
02266	Everything else is a bonus.
02267	Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts.
02268	This is the interesting part.
02269	I haven't been ill at all.
02270	They just thought it was extremely good acting.
02271	That was the difference today.
02272	The City welcomed the brighter outlook.
02273	We felt it was sufficient.
02274	He was seen as the enemy.
02275	These people are not big names.
02276	This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst.
02277	We did it for the jersey.
02278	He was just a journalist.
02279	We have turned the corner.
02280	The Queen Mother is dead.
02281	However, the approach is not believed to be hostile.
02282	Change will however have to be in euros.
02283	It was a big departure.
02284	The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen.
02285	I had a ball today.
02286	He refused to name the survivors.
02287	We created so many chances.
02288	Our house was very small.
02289	It became difficult for me.
02290	It's not a lack of effort.
02291	They will notice a difference.
02292	Football is a passion for many.
02293	The result is a vacuum.
02294	I've heard this stuff about the markets.
02295	The hearing was due to continue today.
02296	But his attendance is not guaranteed.
02297	The colours are very pretty.
02298	He is a lovely man.
02299	Becoming a father was wonderful.
02300	I was on a roll.
02301	He said to give a local injection.
02302	You are a gambling man.
02303	Before it was an ordeal.
02304	I love the spectacle of cinema.
02305	We will try to find someone.
02306	I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood.
02307	I enjoy the creative process.
02308	But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers.
02309	We will provide immediate access.
02310	He could do nothing about it.
02311	It would seem a natural progression.
02312	Being involved at that level is like an addiction.
02313	It's not like us.
02314	It is not a financial issue.
02315	The striker needed attention before he could resume.
02316	He is not a team captain.
02317	Greenwood said he was happy with that.
02318	Overall, the labour market continued to tighten.
02319	That is not the case.
02320	They could not match it.
02321	Each case is treated on merit.
02322	Says the Duke of York.
02323	I had too much to drink.
02324	That is a waste of energy.
02325	The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland.
02326	It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink.
02327	It shows the strength of the roots.
02328	This youngster is so exciting!
02329	It caused a lot of upset.
02330	Motorists will buy passes in advance.
02331	My duty is to win.
02332	Tony Blair's official spokesman said.
02333	The early physical reports were clear.
02334	John Daly has a burning ambition.
02335	They are looking at a flotation.
02336	Death is outside the language.
02337	The course has helped a lot.
02338	It had all been arranged.
02339	I am considered a teenager.
02340	This will secure the future of our industry.
02341	People should make their own decisions.
02342	They said that they stood by their statement.
02343	Truth is the child of time.
02344	That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic.
02345	A small number of new jobs will also be created.
02346	It's important to get it right.
02347	Pensions are a long-term investment.
02348	Those overseas offices were great.
02349	On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless.
02350	Half of young people had had contact with the police.
02351	It was quite a new prescription.
02352	It is very hard for her.
02353	He also launched a new strategy for the agency.
02354	It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised.
02355	He will go on the bench.
02356	We accept the new rules.
02357	We run within the law.
02358	We have the moral high ground.
02359	It has all been done in secret.
02360	She always wanted her own way.
02361	And that match was played in June.
02362	Maloney is an engaging talent.
02363	The rescue package is public money.
02364	I am a retailer by nature.
02365	We can work all night.
02366	It was really very frightening.
02367	It was an excellent performance.
02368	The answer is with ourselves.
02369	That is the real test.
02370	It aims to produce its report before Christmas.
02371	All winners should be tested.
02372	I can live with it.
02373	A lot has been written.
02374	And he goes with it.
02375	The law will take its course.
02376	I didn't have the reply.
02377	These days will be back.
02378	That decision has already been made.
02379	The game is now open.
02380	It was almost too much.
02381	The idea was first mooted a year ago.
02382	It's a policy which has worked for us.
02383	The confidence isn't there now.
02384	He had no previous convictions.
02385	Scotland is the home of golf.
02386	They have broken that promise.
02387	It's only a matter of scale.
02388	We must put a marker down.
02389	She said they would appeal.
02390	It's as wide as a church in here.
02391	The work with Alison was a great experience.
02392	It was like a weekly wage.
02393	We used to keep our business rates.
02394	Everything is now in place for Manchester.
02395	Everyone could see the joke.
02396	All would be under threat.
02397	I understand the frustration of the fans.
02398	The seller was not revealed.
02399	People are on the alert.
02400	I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call.
02401	They know it'll be fantastic.
02402	It brought in new management.
02403	The following day I used the story.
02404	The Cabinet is split over the issue.
02405	It certainly appeared that way.
02406	I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday.
02407	We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow.
02408	I will be able to say in a couple of weeks.
02409	But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong.
02410	He seems to be used to the attention.
02411	The trick is to try it.
02412	He may have a point.
02413	He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response.
02414	My husband was born in Zimbabwe.
02415	I've got my own ideas.
02416	I think it's a miracle.
02417	They were not complacent in any way.
02418	They did the right thing.
02419	He will be judged by his actions.
02420	The fate of the rest is unknown.
02421	It is an absolute nonsense.
02422	Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade.
02423	Sadly, the surface was a nightmare.
02424	Everything in golf is a balance.
02425	It is a case of pity for us.
02426	I believe the gap is nearly there.
02427	Paris is not only young.
02428	However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request.
02429	But you can go beyond that condition.
02430	But we have built a platform for next season.
02431	It looked like a war zone.
02432	He said current trading was strong.
02433	I chose to make a film.
02434	I can tell you Labour is fighting to win.
02435	But by that time, it was too late.
02436	The damage is all inside.
02437	We would have concerns about that.
02438	I know the worry over Iraq.
02439	Taxes may need to rise.
02440	Equally the employee could claim a public interest.
02441	Phil Mickelson did that last year.
02442	No options are excluded at all.
02443	We are going for it.
02444	Miss Jackson was not present to put her case.
02445	It is a cause for concern.
02446	The weather in the area of the crash was severe.
02447	He deserved a red card.
02448	They were not even allowed to see them.
02449	And she is very clear on this.
02450	And it covers the spectrum.
02451	The chief constable has retired.
02452	It will determine whether an offence has occurred.
02453	It is a crisis, without a doubt.
02454	Not if you know the person.
02455	Her body was found about four miles from the car.
02456	I was all image and no substance.
02457	The boys are mentally focused.
02458	It can all be done over the phone.
02459	The bill would be massive.
02460	When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson.
02461	He was certainly upbeat about his chances.
02462	He was a shooting star.
02463	I could feel the blood on my face.
02464	I am a committed European.
02465	Analysts said the offer was fair.
02466	These people attack the core of my beliefs.
02467	He will be advised by me.
02468	Winning a medal is a dream.
02469	We had to add value.
02470	That is the bottom line.
02471	It happens on an annual basis.
02472	However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress.
02473	We have to go for a win.
02474	It worked well in Monaco.
02475	Something has got to change.
02476	I had it before the final.
02477	Our fans have been marvellous.
02478	The BBC was a disgrace.
02479	I would put my money on Peter Donald.
02480	It was still there, but right at the end.
02481	The Prime Minister has been in touch.
02482	They never gave up hope.
02483	He had planned to sell it.
02484	A Scotsman has to defend his castle.
02485	Our idea is to share and lower the cost.
02486	I stayed away from the defence.
02487	Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer.
02488	I think a move would create a lot of interest.
02489	It's a great thing.
02490	It's the only thing.
02491	It is bizarre.
02492	She looked so young.
02493	Life is good.
02494	New York is expected to come to a standstill.
02495	I've had six days of rehearsal.
02496	We have to be sure that the taxation system can work.
02497	The end result is precisely the same.
02498	I was just trying to win the golf tournament.
02499	It may well have been.
02500	He is driven.
02501	Lord Levy said he started life with nothing.
02502	But it was a pleasure.
02503	We want to get to the final, anyway.
02504	Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday.
02505	They had to be cut from the wreckage.
02506	It's a shame.
02507	Does this mean.
02508	It's terrible that he has died the same way.
02509	It's perfectly feasible.
02510	The Scottish Socialist party is also expected to attend.
02511	The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday.
02512	He has the edge.
02513	Is that Titanic?
02514	The idea is simple.
02515	It is huge.
02516	The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough.
02517	Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat.
02518	We are now up against it.
02519	He was the Bill Gates of theatre.
02520	I was in the train station overnight.
02521	We knew we had the goal we wanted.
02522	He is keen to stay in public service.
02523	I looked again at its vision for a Scottish Parliament.
02524	This is a sad day.
02525	It is tough, but possible.
02526	The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small.
02527	Our strategy is straightforward.
02528	Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month.
02529	The sisters also became the two top players in the world.
02530	Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster.
02531	I began to pray.
02532	By hard work, is the answer.
02533	Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern.
02534	Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final.
02535	The way he took his second goal was brilliant.
02536	They tried to give her advice.
02537	It's a dead end.
02538	They should come forward.
02539	It is not the message alone.
02540	Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton.
02541	It's quite a line-up !
02542	We have spent the last couple of years with acting directors.
02543	It would appear that it has not been a problem.
02544	Both reports appear in the British Medical Journal.
02545	They are different types.
02546	Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling.
02547	There is no link.
02548	This is a question of Islam.
02549	You know the type.
02550	They seem to get away with it.
02551	I intended to look for another club on loan.
02552	Holland won by five wickets.
02553	That could change.
02554	I was the sheep.
02555	However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery.
02556	Scotland has shown the way.
02557	It is no surprise.
02558	They were fantastic.
02559	The parents will have a great time, too.
02560	He can do no wrong.
02561	There was a bit of urgency in the second half.
02562	I would be quite happy for the money to be given back.
02563	It should be scrapped.
02564	The first appeared to be successful.
02565	We must convince the citizens.
02566	Further management changes are planned.
02567	The staff are very good.
02568	Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism.
02569	Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing.
02570	Let there be no doubt about that.
02571	The ambition this year is to improve on last.
02572	Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England.
02573	And so was a photograph.
02574	I remember that day well.
02575	She became a heroine of my childhood.
02576	We want to get back into the Champions League.
02577	It is about regular committed giving which is the real attraction.
02578	Separate approvals would be needed for these.
02579	It comes from reflection or thinking.
02580	The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood.
02581	And they removed a Borderer.
02582	He is too weak to move.
02583	Has the conflict started?
02584	Have I really come to this?
02585	They desperately want some stability.
02586	We work for the athlete.
02587	He will need that machine.
02588	We hadn't really taken that seriously before.
02589	It's the performance we want.
02590	Then they scored two goals to win.
02591	In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson.
02592	The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government.
02593	Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer.
02594	And then there's the racial hassle.
02595	The wingers must have felt the cold.
02596	I am relishing the challenge.
02597	No plans for projects are yet in place.
02598	But the organisers refused to worry.
02599	We have to keep our clients.
02600	The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee.
02601	He's very young and very keen to do well.
02602	It is somewhere to be.
02603	We should all be grateful.
02604	This is equally relevant to the landowner.
02605	He thought she was amazing.
02606	The result is utterly compelling.
02607	Final proposals will be published in February.
02608	He seems to have everything.
02609	There can be no compromise on welfare.
02610	It wasn't possible to relax.
02611	He was at home with his pals.
02612	It will take a few years before we see the full benefit.
02613	It's very dangerous for markets.
02614	The fans would love it.
02615	That would be the case with Dundee.
02616	Brian Wilson is a former Member to watch award winner.
02617	Talk of a crisis is absurd.
02618	Their mandate is to target inflation.
02619	We have thought about doing lots of things.
02620	England were ahead until two minutes into injury time.
02621	This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service.
02622	Harrowing is easy, after all.
02623	Those people must be accountable.
02624	If they liked it then I'll be happy.
02625	It's very bad timing, but it's happened.
02626	Accordingly, financial restructuring is required.
02627	Many others are subjected to violence by men.
02628	It's going to be epic.
02629	Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed.
02630	This is a sizeable part of our business.
02631	Diversions were put in place.
02632	We're very interested in opening up in Germany.
02633	The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength.
02634	No one person or small group could be singled out.
02635	Monty is great in his own backyard.
02636	Brown also believes in Walker's innocence.
02637	Even the winning club was within seconds of disaster.
02638	But it looks good for next year.
02639	All the employees are redundant.
02640	His claims were criticised by Chief Secretary to the Treasury Andrew Smith.
02641	Four meetings have previously been arranged.
02642	Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future.
02643	The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible.
02644	And they all have a vote.
02645	Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us.
02646	Drink and petrol prices remain untouched.
02647	That's what happened against Ayr.
02648	Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly.
02649	Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe.
02650	He was just like a godfather to it.
02651	The milk industry is in turmoil.
02652	Yet the survey has been cautious.
02653	The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest.
02654	YOU cannot blame the turnout.
02655	We can't get over it.
02656	They almost achieved a draw.
02657	I can see it now.
02658	This is a step backwards.
02659	I've no idea how it works.
02660	We continue to hold the shares.
02661	The festivals will be about having fun.
02662	Emergency services were also on stand-by outside.
02663	Hopefully they will just give me the degree.
02664	The changes took effect from June.
02665	Since then, things have improved.
02666	We're very fortunate to have these new products to focus on.
02667	The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager.
02668	Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax.
02669	They keep the atmosphere in mind.
02670	Scottish football is finally on its way back.
02671	This is a frightening development.
02672	He is survived by his wife and two sons.
02673	You just have to accept.
02674	There is no evidence that these people are helpful.
02675	The Yugoslav army will still be there.
02676	He has had success at every level.
02677	This Patton will also return.
02678	Tiger is not the norm.
02679	His words were not audible.
02680	There was a fine line to tread.
02681	The refund is fully justified.
02682	But experts have disputed that statistic.
02683	It is time for confession.
02684	He has many offers from the English Premiership.
02685	Hospital staff described his condition as serious but stable.
02686	In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations.
02687	It was started almost by accident.
02688	I will not take part in Edmonton.
02689	Bottling is now the core business.
02690	The study is expected to last until the middle of the year.
02691	People have been wonderful beyond belief.
02692	We were right to be afraid.
02693	The music is therefore profoundly subversive.
02694	Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else.
02695	Its's all change at Kilmarnock.
02696	No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday.
02697	Others may have, but I'm a fighter.
02698	There's always the next century.
02699	For businesses, the benefits will be enormous.
02700	That proved enough to settle the home side down.
02701	Here was an anti supporting the Bill.
02702	Five years later, the deception continued.
02703	Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers.
02704	It is crucial for both teams.
02705	Mr Blair had done well.
02706	I was a lucky man tonight.
02707	Then we will face the Danish champions.
02708	But it couldn't happen overnight.
02709	Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement.
02710	My Dad is a hero.
02711	This wasn't just a big crowd.
02712	It was a terrible combination of factors.
02713	This is absolutely not true.
02714	Arsenal refused to be evicted.
02715	It's about time something was done about equipment.
02716	The agreement remains the only show in town.
02717	The question is whether private investors should follow their example.
02718	The strong performance is expected to continue.
02719	It was a bit of a tightrope.
02720	It's never great to finish second.
02721	I'm delighted that Celtic have done so well this season.
02722	Her political persuasion is no secret.
02723	Initial market reaction was close to euphoric.
02724	He is a right bastard.
02725	Bobby Williamson has been brilliant.
02726	He is not a pathetic figure.
02727	The feedback from audiences was just so positive.
02728	I came up through the ranks.
02729	First, the programme was unbalanced.
02730	The happiness was slightly misplaced.
02731	This championship is different from the other majors.
02732	But I was glad to see these interviews.
02733	They are determined to make a meaningful contribution.
02734	He is a serial Conservative assassin.
02735	Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager.
02736	Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute.
02737	She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport.
02738	We've had great things in the past.
02739	It has been recorded twice.
02740	But there's an upturn in the sector.
02741	They will probably come back.
02742	No-one is predicting a sudden rebound.
02743	Friday night was a pretty good night.
02744	You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice.
02745	We are trying to clarify the issues.
02746	Pulled a huge number of viewers.
02747	Movie stars are public property.
02748	That moment when the monster is being brought to life.
02749	Here the picture is broadly stable.
02750	Sadly, it does not end there.
02751	Jim has not been a problem for me at all.
02752	Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow.
02753	We believe a third party was involved.
02754	And we have the experience.
02755	Celtic were the losers then.
02756	Their conclusions were never published.
02757	Confidence among the allies began to slip.
02758	Little is known about them.
02759	Margins are also in retreat.
02760	Golf is not like that.
02761	It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed.
02762	They will always be in our hearts and in our minds.
02763	He was admitted to hospital.
02764	Thereafter they were allowed to proceed.
02765	We've had him with us for the past six weeks.
02766	Harry Potter has lost his magic.
02767	Today we must not repeat that mistake.
02768	Dancing will help his ankles and his feet.
02769	He is the son of former chairman, Lord Wolfson.
02770	Scottish consumer protection groups were generally receptive to the proposals.
02771	I'm very relieved that I have finally won.
02772	My father died in childbirth.
02773	This measure is not adjusted for seasonal factors.
02774	They're going to open in early summer.
02775	I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio.
02776	I saw them last week.
02777	It was a good workout.
02778	His background is firmly in venture capital.
02779	We can have no complaints.
02780	Not that Barber has been unhappy.
02781	We will likely look for new investors.
02782	But the rally was short-lived.
02783	But you never won any games.
02784	It didn't matter who was in their way.
02785	I have little time for analysts.
02786	The most important thing in theatre is to listen.
02787	It was really quite amazing.
02788	It represents a complete change in emphasis.
02789	It was cynical and callous.
02790	He did not say that.
02791	His successor was only appointed last month.
02792	I've had three shots and got nowhere near.
02793	It's difficult to put a date on.
02794	The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high.
02795	He was dead on arrival at hospital.
02796	Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie.
02797	Six games without defeat is the legacy so far.
02798	Standard Life has also highlighted ambitions in this market.
02799	Colin is free to speak with other teams.
02800	Clearly, the IRA has got away with murder.
02801	He left the hospital without receiving any medication.
02802	Venus rejects the very suggestion.
02803	That remains the unanswered question.
02804	Everything has its place and purpose.
02805	Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country.
02806	And it had two seats.
02807	But nothing could be done.
02808	Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service.
02809	However, civil rights campaigners welcomed the ruling.
02810	This would discourage investment and job creation.
02811	We have no information on Iraq.
02812	They prefer the short, intensive session.
02813	The company declined to comment.
02814	It also makes a habit of collecting people.
02815	Got to get my sunglasses.
02816	We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre.
02817	It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused.
02818	Messages have to be reinforced.
02819	Not many people like to do that.
02820	We go there with confidence.
02821	It was like the old days.
02822	They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game.
02823	I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me.
02824	The only problem was, they were on himself.
02825	We are aiming for early March.
02826	We discovered that for ourselves.
02827	Princess Margaret is being buried on that day.
02828	Now we see no mention of rising rates.
02829	Still, some additions are inspired.
02830	I believe we can handle this okay.
02831	The whole experience was uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time.
02832	Hard cash is needed now.
02833	Our performance continues to be outstanding.
02834	Celtic are simply trying to buy time by not paying the money.
02835	Either way, it's very funny.
02836	We didn't want any trouble.
02837	It seemed a logical expansion.
02838	Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director.
02839	Now it has doubled in size.
02840	I have worked as a stand-up there often.
02841	They failed to reach agreement yesterday.
02842	It is business as usual.
02843	They might have asked, for goodness sake.
02844	The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale.
02845	We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage.
02846	There isn't the seriousness of other businesses.
02847	It is about control of our economy.
02848	That's all I was trying to do today.
02849	I might well have done so already.
02850	That can cost him a fortune.
02851	This matter has still to come before the European Parliament.
02852	But not a penny has been paid.
02853	We must learn to finish.
02854	New York is my home.
02855	Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell.
02856	I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward.
02857	That's been the difference between the sides.
02858	All manner of precaution and protection are taken.
02859	Perhaps we should do the same.
02860	Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight.
02861	Everything is possible in football.
02862	I'm pleased with the horse.
02863	The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV.
02864	Let's not be too despondent.
02865	The Government does not go far enough.
02866	He phoned the number in the brochure.
02867	I haven't got there yet.
02868	I can understand the frustrations of our fans.
02869	They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area.
02870	Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family.
02871	Or so the theory goes.
02872	He has really done well.
02873	George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision.
02874	But I had never been in a theatre.
02875	It was fun, but not a living.
02876	Kenny Miller might come through.
02877	Sales are falling after years of growth.
02878	But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence.
02879	We have a major concern about enforcement action.
02880	I am so proud of him.
02881	He will be kept informed.
02882	He was a lovely man.
02883	People will have to be patient.
02884	I can't remember a lot of it.
02885	Instead, another depression came in.
02886	It is sometimes like that.
02887	The partners are looking for answers.
02888	I've had it for the exams.
02889	We feel very comfortable in this international environment.
02890	The error appeared in a warrant.
02891	They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life.
02892	Their season has been consigned to history.
02893	Maybe he has been away from British football for too long.
02894	Last weekend was extremely frustrating.
02895	Gary Parker is a favourite of mine.
02896	The allegations were still under investigation, he added.
02897	It is the only practical access for vehicles and men.
02898	So it was at Easter Road.
02899	A move to Manchester United would be tremendous.
02900	Absences should be carefully monitored.
02901	He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels.
02902	We just have to adapt.
02903	He was forced to quit.
02904	I was given no instructions by no-one.
02905	He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by.
02906	It is a good lifestyle.
02907	Our relationship has been very good.
02908	Nato has left them with no other option.
02909	Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive.
02910	I think the referee was good.
02911	I understand the medical concerns.
02912	Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National.
02913	This was a unique election.
02914	They exist in name alone.
02915	We have reacted well to each other.
02916	Having guidelines in advance is helpful.
02917	Those three weeks are totally lost.
02918	She is in good spirits.
02919	As if that is an achievement.
02920	Mr Blair should be warned.
02921	There was a fossil on screen.
02922	Structural changes were also required.
02923	That was just one night.
02924	Millions of British jobs depend on Europe.
02925	Sloppy answers are to be avoided.
02926	That is an entirely unacceptable position.
02927	In addition, margins have been maintained.
02928	Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors.
02929	Two years of building a business will go up in smoke.
02930	He said the director had been completely friendly.
02931	It's been a humbling year.
02932	Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces.
02933	It is all to do with the coaching.
02934	We are now working with full-time on future product.
02935	He is a very talented player.
02936	I would be surprised if he decided to give up.
02937	The protest will go ahead as planned.
02938	IT S all change at Kilmarnock.
02939	The business has expanded rapidly, however.
02940	But it's an enjoyable job.
02941	Finding suitable replacements would not be easy.
02942	Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow.
02943	Of course, it is a tough assignment.
02944	Jackie is passionate about Scotland.
02945	Further details are expected later.
02946	This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment.
02947	I've come here for the jersey.
02948	The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent.
02949	She replied, It could be.
02950	Allen is strong in every shape and form.
02951	Adventure is the champagne of life.
02952	We have expanded too quickly.
02953	I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked.
02954	Boats and other equipment would be pooled.
02955	Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night.
02956	The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups.
02957	The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls.
02958	This comes down to a problem of arrogance.
02959	A winter of discontent awaits.
02960	I thought we were fantastic.
02961	It's going to be very closely watched.
02962	It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals.
02963	There is no internal damage.
02964	It could be done by experts and lawyers.
02965	Aberdeen had little to offer.
02966	It was a pre-emptive strike.
02967	This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude.
02968	We may need to take some very radical measures.
02969	Everyone can have their opinion.
02970	The best thing for me was to join the Army.
02971	Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract.
02972	Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached.
02973	That should give me a chance.
02974	They have played their part.
02975	The company hopes to repeat the process in France.
02976	The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday.
02977	I have been very nervous.
02978	There were also some interesting questions and answers.
02979	It wasn't about her singing, though.
02980	It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years.
02981	And they haven't taken the foot off the gas.
02982	Royal Bank declined to comment.
02983	Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning.
02984	Twaddle is a case in point.
02985	It will affect their work.
02986	Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago.
02987	I just felt that I was broken down.
02988	This is the version which appeared in our paper.
02989	Translation - we got it wrong.
02990	They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters.
02991	The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October.
02992	We can't give any figures for Edinburgh.
02993	Walker plans to return indoors.
02994	The actual increases will be announced next month.
02995	The scientific debate is dead.
02996	This would include the GM food industry.
02997	Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh.
02998	He ended up a headmaster.
02999	That took about two years.
03000	He is obviously very dangerous.
03001	This should come as no surprise.
03002	It was launched in February last year.
03003	Commitment is released on Liberty.
03004	We have not been approached.
03005	Murray Johnstone will replace it.
03006	North African countries are also seen as potential customers.
03007	Well, that's just a third district.
03008	She asked for the appointment with me.
03009	This fact is supported by audience research.
03010	Because of that I didn't enjoy the game.
03011	We were beaten by the better team.
03012	Both sides have to step back.
03013	Analysts were impressed with progress made.
03014	I have received no explanation.
03015	Turnover was highest in telecoms.
03016	This game is very evenly balanced.
03017	Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential.
03018	It seems a waste of talents.
03019	Autumn is the time of fulfilment.
03020	You're not getting any goodwill.
03021	It makes no difference to their friendship.
03022	It needs to be sorted out by Easter.
03023	It certainly feels that way.
03024	This idea has been around for four years.
03025	Or maybe it's the other way around.
03026	We are facing a health disaster if we do not act.
03027	He was released after treatment.
03028	All the pieces fit together perfectly.
03029	Things are going to change over the next six months.
03030	Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia.
03031	The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses.
03032	The stage was set for a showdown.
03033	This could put pressure on UK inflation.
03034	They should not feel under threat.
03035	Any error is severely punished.
03036	Either group is living in fantasy land.
03037	That will be a decision for BBC Scotland.
03038	Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning.
03039	This is a great opportunity for us.
03040	Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems.
03041	Inventories are coming under control.
03042	We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives.
03043	Recent reports suggested it might be sold off.
03044	Several hundred people attended yesterday.
03045	Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid.
03046	The money is within the total allocation.
03047	This does not create any precedent.
03048	There's nothing I can say.
03049	We need a visionary producer.
03050	The response from everyone was wonderful.
03051	I am sorry, but I forgot.
03052	Banking stocks were hit hard.
03053	The criminal justice system doesn't deliver.
03054	Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday.
03055	The death toll included five children.
03056	Sales have been perfectly buoyant.
03057	It happened again, and again, and again.
03058	Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services.
03059	They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority.
03060	It's unlikely to be renewed.
03061	The whole thing was just unreal.
03062	They haven't been thought through.
03063	Saturday's match was fairly straightforward.
03064	I am not unduly surprised.
03065	Iain Duncan Smith is wrong.
03066	McPherson came from United Biscuits.
03067	The world record is suspicious.
03068	Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain.
03069	Is this accurate?
03070	It's a real threat.
03071	Who can say?
03072	The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome.
03073	However the drama was still not at an end.
03074	It should be devolved.
03075	It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards.
03076	Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat.
03077	She told The Herald.
03078	He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days.
03079	I see no need for change.
03080	We have every respect for Michelle.
03081	But they did not even get a reply to their letter.
03082	He takes the job.
03083	That all hope is never lost.
03084	Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward.
03085	It had been played at festivals.
03086	It's a question of perception.
03087	In the current outbreak, the reverse is true.
03088	Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear.
03089	It was the same at Twickenham.
03090	It is also well received.
03091	We want to keep the pound.
03092	And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life.
03093	It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland.
03094	And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience.
03095	We want to help them through it.
03096	They really did a great job.
03097	It is a farce.
03098	I am totally surprised.
03099	There would appear to be no motive for the attack.
03100	The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster.
03101	It's all about money, money, money.
03102	The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
03103	We'll have to work hard today.
03104	A Grampian Police spokesman said.
03105	But it will be sorted out this week.
03106	At the time, he was a living legend.
03107	The body follows the mind.
03108	Jobs could go.
03109	It's very safe.
03110	But it's a subtle process.
03111	Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order.
03112	It is hard won.
03113	I am the opposite because I haven't played very much.
03114	He got the same story.
03115	I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country.
03116	He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen.
03117	So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy.
03118	Have a look at our accounts.
03119	Access has been a nightmare.
03120	It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning.
03121	His mother refuses to believe that she is dead.
03122	This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter.
03123	It's like a high school play.
03124	Who did the recruiting?
03125	The plot is minimal.
03126	They will certainly be visible from every house in our area.
03127	Henman has been warned.
03128	It is out there.
03129	They had a confession.
03130	The police have to act to help them.
03131	Locally, too, the MP is under fire.
03132	However, this suggestion was turned down by the player.
03133	The council said the house would have to be demolished.
03134	That would help.
03135	It's been hard.
03136	It's now down in black and white.
03137	She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
03138	We have to pull together, or we will hang apart.
03139	It was ugly.
03140	That time has passed.
03141	As she explains.
03142	Gerhard Schroeder was the victor.
03143	The company yesterday refused to comment.
03144	Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall.
03145	And rugby fans can help.
03146	The city council is a major property owner in the area.
03147	A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue.
03148	That deal will be decided under the existing rules.
03149	The peace process will be buried!
03150	Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe.
03151	Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form.
03152	It was his job to check.
03153	Is that right?
03154	The breakdown was much later in her life.
03155	There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end.
03156	Some of the characters will not be played by humans.
03157	It's not true.
03158	Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October.
03159	It was typical.
03160	He sees a difference in the style of the two teams.
03161	If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden.
03162	We do not get that impression now.
03163	There was no respite.
03164	And I saw the light!
03165	Off I went.
03166	He's not perfect.
03167	He knows a lot.
03168	A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar.
03169	IT S the real thing, for sure.
03170	We have a free vote on these things in our party.
03171	That's the only thing I will say.
03172	It's very nice.
03173	It left me with a sadness.
03174	But he is caught between a rock and a hard place.
03175	It's so awful.
03176	We are a grandmother.
03177	It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland.
03178	The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him.
03179	It is a strong case.
03180	I think I was recorded with a video camera.
03181	I must make that clear.
03182	I would miss him.
03183	I got a yellow card.
03184	The pressure is on Celtic in the main.
03185	So I left.
03186	He has the right attitude but the wrong approach.
03187	His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with.
03188	I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany.
03189	The west coast line is not just for middle England.
03190	The Budget is a boost for Scottish business.
03191	She brought a lot to my life.
03192	Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however.
03193	Thomson and his family left court without comment.
03194	I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club.
03195	But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story.
03196	Each brand was owned by a different family.
03197	That was not perfect golf by any means.
03198	He added that her comments were noted.
03199	She will get through it I'm sure.
03200	Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line.
03201	Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes.
03202	He does not even trust his own members.
03203	He too started on the subs seats.
03204	I'm as fit as I can get.
03205	We took part in a festival called Global Dance.
03206	He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts.
03207	The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said.
03208	Andy was a huge influence yet again.
03209	They seem too much of a sure thing.
03210	Her husband had been waiting for her return.
03211	We just want this season to end.
03212	It was a day she thought she would never see.
03213	Talks have continued at many different levels.
03214	The referee is there to decide these things.
03215	There were no details of the other five victims.
03216	It also has a good labour supply.
03217	Indeed he has a lot of output.
03218	Do not give your details to anyone.
03219	He was failed by his health authority.
03220	But it was not all bad news.
03221	I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these.
03222	But during the bid process, that changed completely.
03223	It turned me against the whole system.
03224	She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were.
03225	I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission.
03226	But two groups refused to sign up.
03227	I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday.
03228	It had little effect on European equity markets.
03229	I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board.
03230	The key to the whole project will be environmental concern.
03231	The squad spent the night at police headquarters.
03232	They said our costs were too high.
03233	I do not attempt to answer that.
03234	It's been a great evening for us.
03235	That kind of growth is the important thing.
03236	A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre.
03237	No plan for projects are yet in place.
03238	Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green.
03239	I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me.
03240	Celtic have a great base of travelling fans.
03241	I can't remember a lot about the accident.
03242	Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones.
03243	They had the appeal of TV stars.
03244	There is no issue of national security involved here.
03245	He will be a very hard act to follow.
03246	Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
03247	Put simply, it goes something like this.
03248	Over one million people have been forced from their homes.
03249	Even if he doesn't have any lines.
03250	I am delighted to hear this news.
03251	We are already seeing some positive results.
03252	We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning.
03253	They won't actually make any money from it.
03254	I bought a flat six years ago.
03255	They are a different team at home.
03256	It took around three minutes from beginning to end.
03257	Scotland is never far away at Westminster.
03258	Some young girls also came by last night.
03259	Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager.
03260	The idea is the shop within a shop.
03261	I left five minutes after he had finished his round.
03262	It is the right package for Scotland.
03263	They have no real friends in the region.
03264	I think there's not much between them.
03265	So I am going in the right direction.
03266	Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult.
03267	It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces.
03268	I could live without the attention, he admitted.
03269	He's got to look after himself now.
03270	He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking.
03271	No country has a similar training programme.
03272	There is no future in rock music.
03273	Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently.
03274	Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies.
03275	We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools.
03276	The programme has been made with great care.
03277	There was only one living room, you see.
03278	I am not under any new pressure.
03279	It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row.
03280	They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat.
03281	All eight victims were based in Germany.
03282	Look, George W Bush will come here in two months.
03283	You should feel involved in their lives.
03284	Three senior officials were dismissed last week.
03285	Time may already have run out for this option.
03286	No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised.
03287	When it happened, he could hardly believe it.
03288	They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes.
03289	As our national coach, Brown is done for.
03290	A progress report will be published in October.
03291	This man could yet win over Scottish hearts.
03292	That will reduce my chance of selection.
03293	When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium.
03294	Surely it can't run for two years.
03295	But the game is still wide open.
03296	It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time.
03297	However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there.
03298	I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight.
03299	We had to work very hard for our points.
03300	That is a big risk at any price.
03301	You need a long-term strategy in football.
03302	He said some things which were better left alone.
03303	If successful, several records will be made.
03304	The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year.
03305	It didn't come as any great surprise.
03306	Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in.
03307	It's just a different way of life.
03308	I am secure in my own position.
03309	Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park.
03310	The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster.
03311	We have come a long way since then.
03312	I made my mind up before we came on tour.
03313	A great player has to win major championships.
03314	Highland health board has a responsibility here.
03315	I didn't miss the big house at all.
03316	The story was not made public by this club.
03317	That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies.
03318	You are not long home from work.
03319	I am fighting the force of nature.
03320	It involved everything in terms of behaviour.
03321	Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere.
03322	But they had to be paid for.
03323	There was no way back for Rangers after that blow.
03324	The police insisted that they were standard issue.
03325	One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone.
03326	I've never had a year like this.
03327	Full details are expected to be released in June.
03328	As you see with the fuel duty business, they do.
03329	Hague will be leader at the election after next.
03330	He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery.
03331	I want an answer from the British Government.
03332	Gas production was also at record levels last year.
03333	They are a victim of their own success.
03334	We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance.
03335	This is a young squad and we're all supporters.
03336	It is going to change the world.
03337	Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager.
03338	People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this.
03339	The study is entirely into the issue of future funding.
03340	I am not going to judge them.
03341	I do not see this so much as failure.
03342	A European final must be the millennium target.
03343	Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time.
03344	I was independent but I am not now.
03345	We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things.
03346	We are still seeking that complete performance.
03347	My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high.
03348	Someone should force President Bush to watch this film.
03349	The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors.
03350	This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses.
03351	Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals.
03352	I want to see as much progress as possible.
03353	This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media.
03354	I felt we played some excellent football in the first half.
03355	The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago.
03356	They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust.
03357	The labour side has developed in the North area.
03358	You are not allowed to do that.
03359	That is the last thing they need.
03360	He has worked for several years in the United States.
03361	The children were later able to leave by bus.
03362	Jim was down there with his wife.
03363	Church leaders warned other homes could close.
03364	The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia.
03365	My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind.
03366	However, the figures tell a different story.
03367	The rise has come too late for some.
03368	Rangers then had a couple of good efforts.
03369	I'd rather play well next week than here.
03370	Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen.
03371	The British Government should follow the Irish example.
03372	Commercial producers were present in large numbers.
03373	Despite his success, things began to fall apart.
03374	Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials.
03375	And they never show the same film as a rival.
03376	Every player goes through this after a serious injury.
03377	There would be a north and south division.
03378	The same trend showed up throughout Britain.
03379	The two companies were not for sale.
03380	His condition was described as serious last night.
03381	The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis.
03382	The board do not own the company.
03383	Last night Bush carried it rather easily.
03384	They always want to give a performance.
03385	Its primary business channel is the internet.
03386	The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned.
03387	I think I was about four years old.
03388	Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday.
03389	It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan.
03390	Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that.
03391	I think the shares are good value.
03392	One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas.
03393	Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas.
03394	The life office will now stay with Abbey.
03395	Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan.
03396	Overall, the last hole was good to the women.
03397	He may be ready for first team action in March.
03398	The fans pay for their season tickets.
03399	In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council.
03400	Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction.
03401	No-one had seen this sort of thing before.
03402	We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost.
03403	He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is.
03404	He would get into any world team.
03405	Its work includes dealing with child abuse.
03406	They first met during a Step in London.
03407	It is based on population rather than need.
03408	He could understand both points of view.
03409	Further heavy charges are expected this year.
03410	It happened on average once a week this year.
03411	Of course people will try the things they see on TV.
03412	For that reason cover should not be given.
03413	He felt too close to head office.
03414	If you believe in the blue and white.
03415	A report on their property is due within days.
03416	He will just go on doing his job.
03417	That's the danger when you have to play too many young players.
03418	The team spirit that was here last year is again good.
03419	This term they are second bottom with three games left to play.
03420	We will not simply hit these people.
03421	We still think this trade is on the increase.
03422	His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland.
03423	I feel as if I can hole everything now.
03424	I try to be open to experience.
03425	He is not exactly a pretty child.
03426	I thought the race was a little bit slow.
03427	If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty.
03428	Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that.
03429	I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career.
03430	These options include the possible merger or sale of the company.
03431	One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday.
03432	Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action.
03433	I hope numbers will be up on last time.
03434	Put another way, they just won't do it.
03435	Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says.
03436	Getting that balance right can be very difficult.
03437	Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right.
03438	Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident.
03439	It was a bit like having children.
03440	And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive.
03441	And that is the bottom line - box office.
03442	I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days.
03443	I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us.
03444	Sales will begin by the end of October.
03445	The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change.
03446	It is not a material issue for a group with our strength.
03447	It is the only natural British site on the list.
03448	His style was direct and very human.
03449	Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done.
03450	The institute board will take the decision.
03451	He's young enough and he must learn.
03452	Such a policy is for long-term strength.
03453	Both players gave so much to the side.
03454	Stephen has never considered the question of compensation.
03455	The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named.
03456	It was a goal which came from nothing.
03457	We have a substantial value of assets on the ground.
03458	I have come here to show support for the families.
03459	We have been going for three years.
03460	He really played us into a corner.
03461	They know the truth, they really know the truth.
03462	It was another black day for Ayrshire.
03463	Otherwise, we might as well hold it now.
03464	It used to be all hard sell.
03465	The direct effects on trade will be limited.
03466	He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money.
03467	This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves.
03468	This is not a small amount of money.
03469	The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week.
03470	The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission.
03471	Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions.
03472	His record on Government has always been highly effective.
03473	My tax affairs have been totally open.
03474	Five years ago its return was rejected.
03475	But soon the game dropped back into its old ways.
03476	In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress.
03477	In that situation, they thought we should be beaten.
03478	We are keen to see truth and justice.
03479	People have a wish to charge twice.
03480	It may be good for the soul.
03481	We want to lift the cup for the fans.
03482	It is about investing in the future.
03483	They were in good humour, too.
03484	These awards will deliver improvements on the ground.
03485	She was at the top.
03486	And they had a case.
03487	Something has to be put in place.
03488	They are going after them.
03489	It is all about the story.
03490	The whole thing is the music.
03491	That is still the case.
03492	In my view, it has to be done.
03493	The pressure on the players will build.
03494	We have got to deliver.
03495	The company continues to grow.
03496	He said it was for sale.
03497	There is a lot to be done.
03498	It was an outstanding performance.
03499	It is only the beginning.
03500	That will be the office.
03501	It would have been around the turn of the century.
03502	I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
03503	It seems a good thing to try.
03504	It sounds a lot of money.
03505	It took an option on the process.
03506	This is a game of confidence.
03507	The door is still open, but we need a bit of help.
03508	On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made.
03509	But he has not become a monster.
03510	He is not a dancer.
03511	We had planned to sell the property for some time.
03512	In the end we have to take a stand.
03513	This is a sea change in approach.
03514	Otherwise, the market may come back.
03515	In the end, we did not spend a penny on him.
03516	He was not alone at the top of the board.
03517	We had a great time.
03518	I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side.
03519	According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland.
03520	It is hard to believe.
03521	Or it would have been.
03522	That was the first step.
03523	I have been in contact with him.
03524	I am the manager of Scotland.
03525	It starts at the top.
03526	Others are expected to follow the lead.
03527	It was all for good reason as well.
03528	There is a lack of staff.
03529	At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived.
03530	We have to create it in the playing strength of the team.
03531	We were all over the place in the first half.
03532	All the pressure was on him.
03533	It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident.
03534	I think the Labour party is completely split on this.
03535	It should never have happened.
03536	The feeling is hard to describe.
03537	That is a question for the next manager.
03538	However, he urged the trade to keep the faith.
03539	I would like to continue to develop.
03540	We want to begin a programme in the UK.
03541	It is not an issue.
03542	Many referees are on a hiding to nothing.
03543	Hopefully, it will bring new customers.
03544	A team is a team.
03545	It decided to blame the media.
03546	It was important to win today.
03547	He was not injured in the attack.
03548	Because he was born in England.
03549	Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said.
03550	It still has an effect.
03551	Other villages were completely deserted.
03552	There is a lot of concern.
03553	It will be decided in the next month.
03554	We have to win the group.
03555	This is a fight to the death.
03556	He is a man of the people.
03557	Sadly, it could not be done.
03558	I wouldn't even respond to that question.
03559	Instead, he missed the lot.
03560	I was never in danger.
03561	It was really good in the first week.
03562	However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman.
03563	That is not the case in Europe.
03564	But it was a loss.
03565	It expected this trend to continue.
03566	But we were in control at that point.
03567	But the government has so far failed to listen.
03568	I am still waiting for a reply.
03569	However, the matter is not going to end there.
03570	Obviously, we would want to look at this.
03571	On a practical level, it would be difficult.
03572	It is important that he is involved.
03573	If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help.
03574	It should be noted that he has been released without charge.
03575	None of the agencies was able to help.
03576	I didn't see the point.
03577	We are in a war.
03578	However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely.
03579	This is a historic agreement.
03580	We have to be realistic.
03581	There was a hole in it.
03582	It will be done in stages.
03583	Every character was completely different.
03584	But it is a similar problem.
03585	In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning.
03586	It involved the same people.
03587	Look at the potential of this club.
03588	He is already in place.
03589	Another difference is the cost.
03590	Tax is a matter for national governments.
03591	It is a sensitive issue.
03592	This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal.
03593	Like many companies, it is a problem.
03594	The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia.
03595	And the context is also completely different.
03596	The banking sector was weak.
03597	But the New Year was special.
03598	This isn't the end of story.
03599	He is a great prospect.
03600	He has been told by the doctor to rest.
03601	Of course, it does not have to be this way.
03602	This latter suggestion is very important.
03603	However, it does not tell the full story.
03604	They were impressive against France.
03605	The challenge is to win a cup.
03606	Hopefully, he will get a lucky break.
03607	It was a test in itself.
03608	Either team will be hard.
03609	However, it has to be seen as part of a package.
03610	In fact, it was almost as if it was expected.
03611	Lately, that market has come under pressure.
03612	I have a good feeling about this.
03613	The news is not all bad.
03614	Some of the passing was a disgrace.
03615	However, it does not seem to be the case.
03616	It is almost certain to be the last.
03617	However, the appeal judges rejected the argument.
03618	I was delighted to accept.
03619	We are not going to fight in Kosovo.
03620	Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance.
03621	It's fantastic to win again.
03622	The company won the first round but lost on appeal.
03623	Everything is in the mix.
03624	An announcement is expected this week.
03625	He will be difficult to replace.
03626	I would be interested in another attempt.
03627	He was on a mission.
03628	One-third of the places are already taken.
03629	I want this one to be different.
03630	It is the last meeting of the season.
03631	He is a quality player.
03632	The service is expected to be introduced in December.
03633	It's all been about the basics of the business.
03634	There is a demand for it.
03635	It's great that it happened in Britain.
03636	Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents.
03637	In order to get there, we have got to invest.
03638	There is no need to panic.
03639	However, he said the proposal was at an early stage.
03640	One day, he threw the baby against a wall.
03641	He's had to suffer for the last six years.
03642	But it was a struggle.
03643	Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
03644	Sure, it's funny.
03645	Sadly, it can't.
03646	Hopefully, we have learned a lot from that game.
03647	He should have asked for a second opinion.
03648	The reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
03649	He's a star.
03650	No date has been set for the appeal.
03651	I have had no social life at all.
03652	We felt at the moment, it was not possible.
03653	Who would have?
03654	He has been under great pressure.
03655	There is a lack of chemistry.
03656	I was awful.
03657	The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight.
03658	We wanted it left for a wee while.
03659	I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react.
03660	We must keep our feet on the ground.
03661	The red card was okay.
03662	We don't even know his name.
03663	The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans.
03664	He demanded to speak to the boss.
03665	They had no children.
03666	I might get an injury very easily.
03667	I didn't need to watch it on the video.
03668	It is nearly there.
03669	they fail to engage.
03670	I HAVE a dream.
03671	We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians.
03672	Of course I was tempted.
03673	You've got to have both sides.
03674	Well, he can do it.
03675	But it is understood to have happened after weeks of arguments.
03676	The goals will come.
03677	It's just not funny!
03678	and that another interested body should have an option to buy.
03679	It also provides a wealth of contrast within the movement.
03680	Work is under way to create a studio in Inverness.
03681	I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death.
03682	Action is needed now.
03683	There's no place to hide.
03684	A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference.
03685	The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals.
03686	But nothing happened.
03687	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by raindrops which causes the rainbows.
03688	He was jailed for five years.
03689	Then, suddenly, they weren't.
03690	Is a drug dealer?
03691	There is no reason at all.
03692	The State would provide.
03693	Every aspect of our play was first class.
03694	A play is a set of actions.
03695	It is a blow.
03696	It will be tight.
03697	Tony Blair said as little.
03698	This one did.
03699	But I was wrong.
03700	It is home-grown.
03701	However, we have not come to any conclusions.
03702	That would be unlawful.
03703	I was fighting for my life, I thought.
03704	I had some time with Aston Villa.
03705	It is not a U-turn.
03706	I just wanted a break.
03707	She said she would not welcome the flowers.
03708	We work well together.
03709	No-one in Downing Street can speak the language of the unions.
03710	He realises his mistake.
03711	He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant.
03712	I was stunned.
03713	We should do everything at a stroke.
03714	As we worked.
03715	Tony had arrived.
03716	The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate.
03717	It's to do with context.
03718	Does this matter?
03719	It was very frightened and dirty.
03720	I do not own the vessel in question.
03721	I will win.
03722	I have decided to quit the show.
03723	The report is due out next month.
03724	Because they didn't want to know.
03725	It's not before time.
03726	I didn't play too well in the third quarter.
03727	He said the winner had been chosen by consensus.
03728	Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party.
03729	But you think I'm going to argue with the big man?
03730	You should be.
03731	We will need to study the report before any decision is taken.
03732	I could have got out a long time ago.
03733	Souter will be back.
03734	We are happy.
03735	It is so very obvious.
03736	But I've won both ways.
03737	You feel very helpless.
03738	Dialogue is the key.
03739	It was good.
03740	Bombing slaughter rejected
03741	We are not going to forget.
03742	No Briton has ever won.
03743	And huge, indeed, it is.
03744	She is really magic.
03745	We could easily be cut again.
03746	I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record.
03747	She is on a life support machine.
03748	It's too horrible to think.
03749	He scored a touchdown.
03750	This is the last straw.
03751	Two people were interviewed.
03752	He loved the moment.
03753	Our policy is clear.
03754	Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match.
03755	He had taken everything from me.
03756	Until they came to do it.
03757	Their time has gone.
03758	They are very clever in their use of words.
03759	I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah.
03760	The company did not declare a dividend.
03761	That is the face of fear.
03762	It is serious - but not that serious.
03763	Merger would be entirely logical.
03764	It's not a swimming pool out there.
03765	The outcome of their game isn't the important thing.
03766	We would have concerns about suspension.
03767	The couple actually came upon the accident.
03768	We could soon be in that same position!
03769	It came as a surprise.
03770	The Farmer wants a new campaign.
03771	You should try to have a laugh.
03772	The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous.
03773	The party is up for it.
03774	It makes for an interesting conference.
03775	Petrol prices were widely blamed.
03776	The woman is basically off her head.
03777	He had missed a penalty against the English.
03778	Our preference is to play in midweek.
03779	We haven't finished the complaints procedure.
03780	We made a world record together.
03781	Athletics is on a roll in the country.
03782	Our offer represents an attractive price for the business.
03783	We deserve a significant rise.
03784	The website has changed the company.
03785	However, the problem is timing.
03786	But it could be a consequence of our policy.
03787	This is the highlight of my career.
03788	I learned that only yesterday.
03789	I have accepted the challenge.
03790	But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner.
03791	That is the ultimate revenge.
03792	His second goal was equally impressive.
03793	Nothing was meant by it.
03794	It is vital to clarify their role.
03795	Talks are at an advanced stage.
03796	The Royal Highland was no exception.
03797	I will have to order its destruction.
03798	That could bring the peace process to a standstill.
03799	Losing in that manner is very hard to take.
03800	His injury was completely random.
03801	The output price index in December was unchanged on November.
03802	It was finally agreed on Saturday.
03803	The process will start tomorrow.
03804	The transaction is not feasible.
03805	It will be strictly cross-country.
03806	Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle.
03807	He does not much like the Liberal Democrats.
03808	She was an only child.
03809	They have to be able to play the game.
03810	I am not going to go tomorrow.
03811	Others agreed with this view.
03812	I have never heard a rule that you could be too young.
03813	Mr Smith declined to comment.
03814	Labour was too busy to respond.
03815	You can never tell with the manager.
03816	He has also cut a record.
03817	Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed.
03818	He is quite well organised.
03819	It was a minor incident.
03820	There were no problems with the crowds.
03821	Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families.
03822	I understand the security issue.
03823	We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service.
03824	A revival is under way.
03825	They were worth the money.
03826	The circumstances have changed since last year.
03827	Mr Clinton was asked about his memory.
03828	But it has been an amazing experience.
03829	The effect was almost magical.
03830	Britain is going to celebrate in style.
03831	The weather will be unpredictable if anything.
03832	His appeal is instantly understood.
03833	A Home Office spokesman said.
03834	His only reply was a laugh.
03835	Job losses were also announced.
03836	Investors can be forgiven for caution.
03837	This is a moment to seize.
03838	The people will not be patient.
03839	We will listen to any suggestion.
03840	It was an achievement all right.
03841	The whole thing is utterly transparent.
03842	It is inherent in society.
03843	Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis.
03844	Other people had looked at it.
03845	It was tough to contain the excitement.
03846	The pain is still acute.
03847	He said something in his work.
03848	It's wonderful to have won.
03849	It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped.
03850	It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem.
03851	He can handle it without any problem.
03852	I think we'll just keep it.
03853	He had no access to the database.
03854	The members have voted against it.
03855	That is a crazy situation.
03856	Two things were clear from the new programme.
03857	Yesterday was a statement of intent.
03858	The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment.
03859	The major championships will always have a special place.
03860	The team hadn't been picked.
03861	Glasgow University declined to comment.
03862	He will consult the right people.
03863	Rugby has an extended run.
03864	It has happened for generations.
03865	Theatre is not a museum.
03866	It seems a long time ago.
03867	Ferguson must take the blame.
03868	I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson.
03869	I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters.
03870	But the foundations have been laid.
03871	But they can also be managed by telephone.
03872	Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning.
03873	George is on a two-day visit to Scotland.
03874	Shelter also supports the reform.
03875	This market has been neglected by the whisky industry.
03876	That is not the position of the British relatives.
03877	The projections are very positive for South Africa.
03878	That's been all around Europe with me.
03879	Surrey police said no body had been found.
03880	It was submitted without their knowledge.
03881	Being captain of this club is fantastic.
03882	A similar scheme is under way in central Scotland.
03883	Such an attack is bizarre.
03884	The success of the Open Eye has enabled the business to expand.
03885	No date has been fixed for his return.
03886	No-one wanted to run it tonight.
03887	There is another important factor.
03888	Strangely enough I felt very sharp.
03889	An alternative must be offered.
03890	The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment.
03891	There is no hiding place.
03892	Their condition is described as satisfactory.
03893	Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities.
03894	The Allies intend to maintain the average.
03895	It wouldn't matter if he had.
03896	That will be best for him.
03897	There were no formal announcements.
03898	He deserves a second chance.
03899	It could cause a little bit of disruption.
03900	Police have appealed for witnesses.
03901	People are so negative about the whole business.
03902	Discussions will continue with the industry in Scotland.
03903	It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation.
03904	It might be useful to have something in black and white.
03905	It's because they can't understand the language.
03906	The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue.
03907	I'm very passionate about my country.
03908	I think it's a great system.
03909	They're just a good retailer.
03910	That should get their attention.
03911	Now that business is banned.
03912	At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues.
03913	We will now look into its historical background.
03914	It's a relief that a decision has finally been made.
03915	Because it's a waste of time for both sides.
03916	But the law is very clear on this.
03917	It will take time.
03918	It's good news and long overdue.
03919	He was possessed
03920	But the fans deserve to know!
03921	It's a crucial award.
03922	Last month he made his debut in Japan.
03923	That includes the equipment?
03924	They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today.
03925	Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut.
03926	I cannot say too much about them.
03927	Today was first class.
03928	The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors.
03929	I've got to hold my own hands up for this one.
03930	I have spoken to the skipper.
03931	It's the same as Glasgow.
03932	I haven't made the donation yet.
03933	I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board.
03934	I am totally horrified by the sentence.
03935	IT S all in the hair.
03936	He was unable to come.
03937	You were very proud that day to be among their friends.
03938	It will be very, very tight.
03939	I said that I had been raped.
03940	It is horrible.
03941	Now, though, he has an incentive.
03942	I am a wealthy person.
03943	He's delighted, too, with the new premises.
03944	A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire.
03945	I would love to have him home.
03946	I'm just enjoying every match.
03947	You did not change overnight.
03948	This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad.
03949	It's the traumatic event in the childhood of a nation.
03950	We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that.
03951	It's a question of fashion.
03952	The weaknesses are few.
03953	It's a logical consequence of the Formula.
03954	They say that vital evidence was not heard in the court.
03955	I'm so worried about the roads.
03956	But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition.
03957	It should be easy.
03958	We have to recognise that he is an elusive character.
03959	Sir Paul McCartney said he had been shocked by the attack.
03960	He has a lot of experience as a captain in his career.
03961	This is a good move for me.
03962	It is very important that we get the balance right.
03963	It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland.
03964	He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky.
03965	Things can change.
03966	Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school.
03967	I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry.
03968	In fact, they have the opposite effect.
03969	I am pretty careful with money.
03970	We will not tolerate it.
03971	It was just appalling luck.
03972	Costs have got to be controlled.
03973	Strikers like to go to the ground.
03974	Planting is unlikely to start before next spring.
03975	I had trouble with the producers.
03976	The teacher would have approved.
03977	Let's hope that it does.
03978	Companies are now seeking to recover their losses.
03979	This is the first step.
03980	We are talking about the outskirts of London.
03981	I am about protecting the state pension.
03982	There's nothing they can get on me.
03983	We had a court hearing in London yesterday.
03984	I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence.
03985	William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted.
03986	We are progressing with a few interested parties.
03987	The excitement could hardly be contained.
03988	The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation.
03989	It is high time to act.
03990	We have made no final decisions.
03991	We knew they could do it.
03992	They must be on commission.
03993	Mr Wilson has received no such request.
03994	It's good to have a voice.
03995	The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened.
03996	Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain.
03997	I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling.
03998	That's not an assumption that I had made.
03999	The situation is not easy, but we will prevail.
04000	Figures are not relevant to the strategy.
04001	We have a team to reach the final.
04002	Failure is not an option.
04003	He was pleased with his display.
04004	Life is still very tough for them.
04005	People were actually not on his side.
04006	The defender made an impressive debut.
04007	Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident.
04008	You will be very welcome.
04009	That would open the gates of hell.
04010	Further growth will be funded from cash flow.
04011	But the petrol station does not get the benefit.
04012	It appears that it was just a genuine mistake.
04013	The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions.
04014	This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow.
04015	He was rejected because he had retired.
04016	It may have been a cry for help.
04017	We are going through difficult times.
04018	We've had an enjoyable adventure.
04019	You could feel the heat.
04020	We have to be happy with a British and European record.
04021	British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US.
04022	During the communist time they were very privileged.
04023	She will attend in July.
04024	The most important thing is the game.
04025	There is no timetable for completing such inquiries.
04026	The right decision has been made.
04027	Customers would then be consulted over any changes.
04028	At half-time he was presented to both teams.
04029	He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that.
04030	He is a reporter for us.
04031	We've had several problems over injuries.
04032	That was a disgraceful performance.
04033	It was a kind of contempt.
04034	I felt about this big.
04035	I feel really confident in that department.
04036	Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price.
04037	We shall rely on human beings.
04038	It has the potential to be another North Sea.
04039	We would have no control over the threshold for repayment.
04040	Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
04041	You have to expect this type of thing.
04042	There's still no-one like him.
04043	The takeover comes as no surprise.
04044	It was nice to finish in style.
04045	Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year.
04046	There will be good prospects ahead.
04047	Will have consequences for Scottish universities.
04048	Many of these properties are located in the south of England.
04049	We have very limited capacity.
04050	We're still the only ones in the High Street.
04051	The countryside is in crisis.
04052	She is obviously very disappointed.
04053	He has earned the right to their respect.
04054	The law would appear to be on our side.
04055	The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful.
04056	It has only been rumours.
04057	I was conceived in Aberdeen.
04058	Rugby is a hard game.
04059	My immune system had been depleted.
04060	Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked.
04061	Growth will come later in the cycle.
04062	We're not taking any risks.
04063	The choice is strictly personal.
04064	It's too close to call.
04065	She started to put on weight.
04066	I wouldn't want to miss that chance.
04067	Russell is delighted with them.
04068	The next few months will tell.
04069	I am astonished at attack.
04070	That was the agreement with the manager.
04071	His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son.
04072	First Minister Donald Dewar will respond.
04073	The trial will open today.
04074	National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals.
04075	THIS is a good day for Scottish farming.
04076	There were a lot of emotions.
04077	We know about the crisis in cattle.
04078	External auditors will monitor the action which is planned.
04079	The people around me were fantastic.
04080	The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland.
04081	The villagers were shot in the head at short range.
04082	The removal would take place in France.
04083	It is a tough game but we have a chance.
04084	I think the goalkeeper should have gone.
04085	They had learned from the lessons of the first game.
04086	It was like someone had died.
04087	The budget was too low for that.
04088	Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up.
04089	Striking the deal has come as a big relief.
04090	This is the stuff of live music.
04091	It may prove to be his last involvement with the club.
04092	The move is considered a major breakthrough.
04093	I see no reason to have this debate at this time.
04094	He certainly did a good job!
04095	Talks between directors have been underway since last month.
04096	I am certainly thinking about retirement.
04097	I have always believed in myself.
04098	Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure.
04099	That argument has been won.
04100	It was a narrow escape.
04101	The processing plant was closed yesterday.
04102	The Israeli military denied the claim.
04103	I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart.
04104	IT has been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock.
04105	I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie.
04106	We would welcome a commercial partner or partners.
04107	Subsidy income will not be affected.
04108	Peace was won.
04109	Was it worth it?
04110	At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough.
04111	They may be wrong.
04112	I was too young.
04113	You will be.
04114	Journalists should make him.
04115	I saw one body.
04116	You are not going in blind.
04117	Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre.
04118	We have got to get it right.
04119	It's just a place to open it.
04120	We are ready.
04121	I am very angry.
04122	Rehearsals will start in the new year for the extended season.
04123	One knows the feeling.
04124	He was not a big name.
04125	In Scotland, we keep the faith.
04126	We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project.
04127	Well, it won't.
04128	They got upset.
04129	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored bands increases as the size of the drops increases.
04130	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-position of a number of bows.
04131	Then nine minutes before half time Kenny Miller struck.
04132	This would include insurance.
04133	It would fit very well with us.
04134	Schools do not create that.
04135	Just look at his fashion sense.
04136	I have every confidence.
04137	We've got a real battle now with Richard.
04138	Instead, we make the ground pay.
04139	This operation will change her life.
04140	Something old something new, as it were.
04141	The youngsters have put us in a strong position.
04142	That's what set him apart.
04143	She continued to enjoy sport.
04144	Downing Street also rejected the calls for a European army.
04145	By all accounts he was delighted.
04146	Schools will not want change.
04147	I think I'm a bit too young.
04148	We wish to win, but not at any price.
04149	I agree with you about this.
04150	Or so he thought.
04151	Must be prepared to use it.
04152	The fifth was found later.
04153	For a decade she was proved right.
04154	It was dangerous but vital employment.
04155	Our people are ready.
04156	These figures cover the major British banking groups.
04157	Probably he wasn't thinking at all.
04158	Some of their players seemed almost dead.
04159	People come to see the Highlands.
04160	It would have to be.
04161	That is not possible.
04162	Insurance will perhaps reduce.
04163	What kind of a man does that, Mr Dick?
04164	He has a real potential.
04165	LET there be light.
04166	Scotland has great assets.
04167	That remains the same.
04168	Earlier, both main parties agreed a crucial stage had been reached.
04169	The car driver died.
04170	It looks that way.
04171	Now comes the hard part.
04172	We're at home, which is important.
04173	They prepared some food very quickly.
04174	In his new cabinet role as party chairman, it will become his primary task.
04175	They had three children.
04176	It would be easy to think so.
04177	And so it went on.
04178	Scotland were on Saturday.
04179	We want the results as soon as possible before Thursday.
04180	He gets his moment.
04181	The newspapers, by contrast, had held their value.
04182	There was no reason.
04183	It gets too much.
04184	So they should be.
04185	They need the money.
04186	That is the only way to rate players.
04187	Its failure is no surprise.
04188	Consumers will also benefit.
04189	They pointed to the site.
04190	He is at peace with himself.
04191	Gold admitted as much.
04192	It seemed like four hours.
04193	Evidence must not be held back.
04194	We beat the Welsh team.
04195	I saw a lot of good things against Livingston.
04196	Britain's role was to stop it.
04197	Eight others have followed.
04198	We're currently looking at the level of support.
04199	Strong growth is expected from the industrial services division.
04200	It's nice to see a very positive style of football.
04201	It should have its own network.
04202	But this wasn't the full picture.
04203	That shows the impact it had.
04204	Domestic orders have also fallen since January.
04205	I'd always wanted to act.
04206	We hope he will do until he finally does the double.
04207	I am never fully fit.
04208	He nearly killed my son.
04209	I told them during their morning break.
04210	Parents of pupils at the school have also expressed concern.
04211	Mr Dewar understood that.
04212	They have shown great character.
04213	It wasn't a pretty match.
04214	Health experts said they were not surprised by the findings.
04215	The second failed completely.
04216	That apart, though, I feel good.
04217	Sport is good for you.
04218	It was clearly not a battle.
04219	You are looking at specialist staff and specialist staff cost money.
04220	I'd rather be in our position than Rangers.
04221	All options are available.
04222	I knew Donald Dewar.
04223	Parents do not know very much about drugs.
04224	It is actually building on the existing business.
04225	Maybe this battle had been.
04226	Art can challenge our value system.
04227	London remained the favourite.
04228	A child is not a product.
04229	Scottish Life was there over one year.
04230	Now he is back on top again.
04231	The hotel was huge.
04232	There remains some Scottish influence, however.
04233	The role was perfect for Russell.
04234	The price was raised after massive demands from retail investors.
04235	Their bodies were never found.
04236	Business will continue as usual.
04237	I want a free vote.
04238	Fine, said the press officer.
04239	The questions came quick and fast.
04240	The Boys can speak about little else.
04241	We tried four banks.
04242	There is no doubt there's room for us.
04243	The labour side had developed in the North area.
04244	Good records have also been recognised by successful farmers.
04245	Brian was last to join.
04246	Now the door has opened.
04247	Her death is a huge blow.
04248	The global market was about flat.
04249	Three hit the target.
04250	It's used by Ayr Technical College.
04251	The Queen was on the ball yesterday but off the Euro.
04252	We know the problems.
04253	Britain will be little affected.
04254	There is a good reason for this.
04255	That time is not far away.
04256	When I was training.
04257	I did let myself down a bit.
04258	It was a great evening.
04259	We have several options.
04260	Our focus remains on quality revenue.
04261	Perhaps it will happen again.
04262	We were leading by two goals.
04263	It had happened on average once a week this year.
04264	It is very much in the eye of the individual.
04265	It was an accident.
04266	My goals have never changed.
04267	So we kept them waiting.
04268	He makes time for everyone.
04269	The proposal was rejected.
04270	Look at a computer.
04271	He did better then.
04272	But the next day she paid for it.
04273	It is also hoped big name stars could be brought on board.
04274	This was the perfect setting.
04275	The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year.
04276	The long-term trend is equally clear.
04277	I see no reason to doubt that the situation in Scotland is any different.
04278	All films open tomorrow
04279	Paul never gave up hope.
04280	Those three goals in five minutes changed the game.
04281	Their only score of the half came from a penalty by Jones.
04282	It is a dangerous sport.
04283	Oil stocks also provided a boost.
04284	The future might well be green after all.
04285	Donald felt it would be an appropriate thing to do.
04286	His season started this afternoon.
04287	He is a good signing for Rangers.
04288	White would like to buy further bus businesses.
04289	Kenny and I are ready.
04290	He also worked on general building contracts in the area.
04291	He followed the Italian route.
04292	Stephen had never considered the question of compensation.
04293	So does every industry.
04294	Tomorrow will be my last.
04295	But there's also a love for the songs.
04296	His career may also provide food for thought for Ferguson.
04297	We must move on.
04298	It's just an area of water.
04299	We have achieved that.
04300	Their eyes, however, told a different story.
04301	Good players have become bad.
04302	Many events are down on numbers.
04303	He had served his time.
04304	It was a total surprise.
04305	If a service doesn't pay it will go.
04306	Motherwell took them from half chances.
04307	One finding emerged clearly.
04308	There was no consultation with the executive and no need for any such consultation.
04309	We lost to a poor team.
04310	We have clearly become well established.
04311	Murray plays down return
04312	Other teams moved up too.
04313	Not one person spoke badly.
04314	We were caught out.
04315	We want immediate action.
04316	Someone should tell them.
04317	But it won't help British farmers.
04318	Because I think it's there.
04319	If we get the wrong candidate.
04320	They emerged before the patients left hospital.
04321	They will now remain split up.
04322	We are a husband and wife team.
04323	It was the September weekend after all.
04324	He would add value.
04325	Sources yesterday said the Royal Bank has declined to back him.
04326	That was our last chance to do something.
04327	Maybe she is right.
04328	I saw one man vote five times.
04329	No sport needs that sort of thing.
04330	The senior management team will be drawn from both companies.
04331	Any increase always has some effect.
04332	They had better be.
04333	He was a great human being.
04334	That seems highly unlikely.
04335	Still, I am delighted.
04336	Analysts welcomed the news.
04337	You will lose benefit because you have broken the rules.
04338	Results of the survey are expected by the end of June.
04339	The whole system is too complex.
04340	He said legal action could be considered.
04341	The European elections revealed a lack of interest and a lack of knowledge.
04342	This is far too high.
04343	These matters can't just be medical decisions.
04344	The referee faces a massive job.
04345	That could be ready within another nine months.
04346	Next league matches Kilmarnock.
04347	An appeal was unlikely.
04348	He said he had now written to Scottish Industry Minister Lord Macdonald.
04349	I got dropped for that game.
04350	No real attempt was made to get orders.
04351	It's clearly a budget.
04352	It's an option, but I can't really comment.
04353	The women are victims here.
04354	I'm not sure that's right.
04355	I've kept him in touch with everything.
04356	There's nothing natural left.
04357	He could still be President.
04358	There's always a case.
04359	The new manager must make tough decisions.
04360	He has worked hard over the years.
04361	It was too difficult.
04362	We will miss him against Celtic.
04363	I managed to do that.
04364	The doctors are quite positive about my progress.
04365	They had to have hospital treatment.
04366	Five local people were injured.
04367	All the dead were believed to have been French.
04368	I'd like to report a murder.
04369	They want to be entertained.
04370	A neighbour said.
04371	I was lost.
04372	My fitness was very poor.
04373	It happened so quickly.
04374	It seems to have worked.
04375	We are on the path of change.
04376	It is a love affair.
04377	Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin.
04378	The mood is upbeat.
04379	We enjoyed it today.
04380	It's not a U-turn.
04381	No production was achieved.
04382	We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider.
04383	I was dead.
04384	I don't know the full story.
04385	Words were not required.
04386	Life becomes a song.
04387	Well, he should know.
04388	In a way he was.
04389	I saw military vehicles in the distance.
04390	Our team is just so young.
04391	We speak about the performance.
04392	It's a fact.
04393	Then another one came.
04394	She is an expert on medical ethics.
04395	In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat.
04396	Eight new hospitals are set to be built.
04397	There were no passengers on board.
04398	It could work.
04399	There's no evidence he was ever there.
04400	She is very distinctive.
04401	We have got to get the points from this one.
04402	It will work.
04403	Our message was inclusive.
04404	Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday.
04405	Yet he left a few days later.
04406	It was only a matter of time before someone was killed.
04407	The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning.
04408	My husband was angry.
04409	The death rates are still as high.
04410	Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again.
04411	It was a funny game.
04412	I'm still an amateur in that sense.
04413	Something is wrong.
04414	At the last I found a bunker.
04415	It's a real problem.
04416	Well, it did last time, he was reminded.
04417	They are good.
04418	I'm glad I came.
04419	I've had my time.
04420	It will take place in July.
04421	But, in fact, the reverse is true.
04422	What would be the point?
04423	It might be.
04424	Relief was beyond belief.
04425	He got his degree.
04426	went on sale.
04427	Mrs Thatcher was in the right place, at the right time.
04428	That may be.
04429	Is there any prospect of this happening?
04430	This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager.
04431	The group is due to report by the end of the year.
04432	The selection process is still at a very early stage.
04433	And I thought - we have to do something with this.
04434	I could see his desire for the job in his eyes.
04435	They are not advertised.
04436	We started to struggle with each other towards the end.
04437	It was a great achievement to win at Wembley.
04438	I grew up listening to these people.
04439	It is a small part, and it's very small in the book.
04440	He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow.
04441	It's a source of deep concern.
04442	The mood is good.
04443	It should be a great game, though.
04444	It was good for us that they lost that day.
04445	Face to face
04446	I am very happy with life.
04447	The service would also make a massive impact on tourism.
04448	We have to reduce the number of plastic bags.
04449	Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum.
04450	I would have loved to play in an Old Firm.
04451	It is also claimed that he was murdered.
04452	Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance.
04453	Eriksson would have approved.
04454	It really is a gift to the world.
04455	The car was just there.
04456	It was on fire.
04457	I felt really good until Friday.
04458	Mr Blair is the problem in Scotland, not the solution.
04459	We want to know about the policy.
04460	Get to know him.
04461	My main concern is that public health is not put at risk.
04462	He sets the nature of his Parliament in simple, realistic context.
04463	The first victory made a huge difference to my career.
04464	And sooner than we may think.
04465	I lost my head.
04466	They are now divorced.
04467	His death was a tragic accident.
04468	But it was for charity, just a bit of fun.
04469	It's like a basketball.
04470	It is mainstream.
04471	It has been declared.
04472	We need to move away from the culture of long hours.
04473	It's all change on the music scene in Manchester.
04474	He promised to lead from the front in battle for entry.
04475	So I did.
04476	I have tonight resigned as member of the European Commission.
04477	I asked for a positive response and I was given one.
04478	They will be destroyed.
04479	The Scottish Prison Service said it could not comment on the visit.
04480	Today, we begin to answer that question.
04481	I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh.
04482	Not so, it seems.
04483	Not because they want to sing about something.
04484	He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday.
04485	A web site is planned for November.
04486	It was nice.
04487	There was no rescue.
04488	It's not perfect.
04489	We should be clear about the role of government.
04490	It is a terrible loss.
04491	People acted too quickly.
04492	We will be victorious.
04493	Chelsea was a great club.
04494	He wrote the letter two days before he died.
04495	They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause.
04496	It is all credit to them today.
04497	I hate the word.
04498	He did his job.
04499	I feel very grateful with everything.
04500	John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow.
04501	Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people.
04502	You feel the pride.
04503	We must do something.
04504	We are delighted at the response from potential employers.
04505	He knew his job inside out.
04506	I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while.
04507	He denied the charge.
04508	However, it's good to turn the page.
04509	It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit.
04510	The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions.
04511	Emotions were complex.
04512	He's already made history.
04513	You ask the question.
04514	Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter.
04515	There was no trouble.
04516	It is not a standing army.
04517	I am the Son of Sam.
04518	She is superb.
04519	It doesn't always work that way.
04520	It is simple, but profound.
04521	No preference emerged.
04522	I've invented a village in East Lothian.
04523	It goes with the job.
04524	Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline.
04525	I recommend a tour.
04526	We are delighted with this outcome.
04527	I have so much respect for him.
04528	We shall be victorious.
04529	Rather than answer, she resigned.
04530	They said so that I would look good in uniform.
04531	It's not about defining styles.
04532	One must hope not!
04533	They should not be blamed for it.
04534	I was just overwhelmed.
04535	It's a miracle.
04536	The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident.
04537	They will form a tribute.
04538	The move has provoked a mixed response.
04539	My conscience is not clear.
04540	We try to keep it right.
04541	Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn.
04542	They were all in a stable condition last night.
04543	It is a private matter between the firm and our staff.
04544	I thought he was my friend.
04545	Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy.
04546	These guys are looking for business.
04547	It is full-scale.
04548	Then , he laughs.
04549	A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September.
04550	Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release.
04551	But it could prove disastrous.
04552	The function of the clerk is to provide advice.
04553	She is employed on short-term contracts.
04554	Child benefit will not be affected.
04555	Several investments have already been made.
04556	I had come back from London.
04557	They had been in Scotland on exercise.
04558	He also has a Scottish grandfather.
04559	He hadn't had them for a long time.
04560	We should keep this recent assault in perspective.
04561	Today it was really enjoyable.
04562	It was a unanimous decision.
04563	Our mother is very worried.
04564	It is normal for me.
04565	Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies.
04566	They will remember this victory for a while.
04567	But they must believe in themselves.
04568	We had another last Tuesday.
04569	It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult.
04570	Reaction to the device was mixed.
04571	Scotland will finish the group in second place.
04572	I'm so grateful for that.
04573	But she was very human.
04574	I haven't made any definite decisions.
04575	We have to speed up the process.
04576	Behind him was his brother.
04577	The woman was his wife.
04578	US is the only country to vote against resolution.
04579	That's not fair to the supporters.
04580	In due course we will make an announcement.
04581	This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill.
04582	We will reform the welfare state.
04583	It's easy to be negative about these things.
04584	It will now be revived.
04585	He said the right things.
04586	You have got the evidence.
04587	It is probably in the culture.
04588	We have a high quality product.
04589	This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment.
04590	Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles.
04591	I will never change our policy on paying appearance money.
04592	The pound has also suffered.
04593	We think the timing is good.
04594	The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached.
04595	Industrial action has to hurt.
04596	Nobody said it was required.
04597	They promised to fight the plans.
04598	He was at school in Devon.
04599	He is an excellent manager.
04600	It was a massive error of judgment.
04601	The principle is quite clear.
04602	It would be quite nice.
04603	This remains the party's policy.
04604	The parties include the Scottish Executive.
04605	The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack.
04606	It sounds like a wish list.
04607	The director will be present.
04608	It is the nature of his party.
04609	It is a serious offence of reckless conduct.
04610	I've had a wonderful career.
04611	It is not over by any means.
04612	They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune.
04613	I watch the other visitors.
04614	It means an enormous amount.
04615	None of the pieces was commissioned.
04616	I never found my rhythm.
04617	In fact, the reasons are simple.
04618	It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes.
04619	Nobody has told the story.
04620	He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review.
04621	It is pretty bad news.
04622	Quality was high in all sections.
04623	They offer a kind of narrative.
04624	She came to the Highland Show.
04625	There was no trouble at all.
04626	The price paid for it was not disclosed.
04627	You have to have a proven track record to get them.
04628	Some problems were too complex.
04629	Their one weakness was running between the wickets.
04630	They have no history.
04631	The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing.
04632	He has written to the minister after meetings on the island.
04633	There's a danger.
04634	We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter.
04635	Lancashire Police said they were not treating the death as suspicious.
04636	It was magic.
04637	I am extremely sad.
04638	They tried to deny it.
04639	She reflects a bit.
04640	The people will come.
04641	It's hard to make these decisions at my age.
04642	Note the date.
04643	They are ready.
04644	The move was also welcomed by the National Union of Journalists.
04645	The parties have been given until today to respond.
04646	There is no excuse.
04647	The whole thing will be great.
04648	We have to expand.
04649	The system can work.
04650	His place in central defence was taken by John Anderson.
04651	The show is at an end.
04652	Your father was a good man.
04653	He was the architect.
04654	This is a big advantage.
04655	We have big ideas.
04656	It is on the news.
04657	That's not the intention at all.
04658	They deserve a lot of credit.
04659	I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes.
04660	However, on this showing it's going to be a difficult task.
04661	All the pressure will be on him.
04662	We are also looking for new licences.
04663	The deal was presented yesterday as a merger.
04664	He can perform well under pressure.
04665	The others have all been in storage for some time.
04666	Check that he is dead.
04667	Several messages can be taken from the occasion.
04668	The balance isn't there at EMI.
04669	But I am still awaiting an answer.
04670	The bank was now involved.
04671	The pension levels will remain the same.
04672	I would probably have to agree with him.
04673	The region is open for business.
04674	It is a body blow.
04675	These men could be anywhere in the world.
04676	DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush.
04677	Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market.
04678	It was his own decision.
04679	I chose to go by the rules.
04680	It has been like that all year for me.
04681	Construction is due to begin in February.
04682	Seven people were critically injured.
04683	Life is too short to be bitter.
04684	A terrorist is a terrorist.
04685	It could be to do with the location.
04686	They have not been in touch with the club.
04687	I need a publishing deal!
04688	This is a family club.
04689	It is the loss of my name.
04690	We have come a long way in the last few sessions.
04691	It was a poor performance.
04692	They must show the commitment and the work to go with it.
04693	The Scotch whisky industry is absent from the agenda.
04694	The offer will run for the next three weekends.
04695	It would be a tragedy if it had to close.
04696	He has run a hell of a race.
04697	A senior party insider said.
04698	This will help our confidence.
04699	His was a huge success story.
04700	That is the general feeling.
04701	It is a potential danger.
04702	You will never get a conviction.
04703	There is a handful of rewarding paintings.
04704	Thousands of British tourists were trapped in their hotels.
04705	The whole family was in shock.
04706	Her life is now back on track.
04707	They are now out in the cold.
04708	He took a draw on his cigarette.
04709	We regret that they were brought in the first place.
04710	He must have seen the movie.
04711	I am a good player.
04712	We operate as a Scottish company.
04713	He has been in a nursing home for two years.
04714	It is good for Europe.
04715	But a surprise is in store.
04716	We're delighted about the vote.
04717	He was on a horse.
04718	That's the way it works.
04719	It will make a huge difference.
04720	Gordon is also highly rated.
04721	The first game is so important.
04722	You have to see the work.
04723	The funding is now there.
04724	I was embarrassed by it.
04725	No one wants to go through these things.
04726	Our legal advice is clear.
04727	It all began as an accident.
04728	Long-term, it was the right thing to do.
04729	They were totally behind it.
04730	She would take the Farmer to the opera.
04731	They are defined by law.
04732	I'm very pleased for the club and for myself.
04733	It's been a long, long journey.
04734	My place is in the kitchen.
04735	I fell against him.
04736	Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party.
04737	It is a freedom.
04738	Jacques Chirac, the French president, was surely in his sights.
04739	That would be my view.
04740	The group is separate from the Real IRA.
04741	It's a big deal for me.
04742	But the military campaign is a military campaign against Osama bin Laden.
04743	The Dow Jones is way up.
04744	A man has since been charged with his murder.
04745	Mentally, you have to be tough.
04746	It would be a massive boost for them.
04747	This is a major step forward for carers.
04748	His remarks appear to have had an effect.
04749	We would like to find another region to develop in England.
04750	Allan Johnston was not match fit.
04751	The idea is not new.
04752	No company would want to put their people at risk.
04753	It could well be the case.
04754	This work on a marketing strategy would be finished within two months.
04755	It seemed the tough times were behind him.
04756	That company should not be allowed to operate in this country.
04757	I didn't think any player was a success on Saturday.
04758	It will now take over the running of the estate.
04759	I've got to provide for my family.
04760	I am pleased to be in them.
04761	It is the only way forward for the club.
04762	It was nice to get a clean sheet.
04763	The insurance company is only interested in your profits.
04764	Thomson is expected to manage the business.
04765	The damage from the fire was huge.
04766	Scottish rugby has been in a state of civil war.
04767	I expected a victory, the pain is enormous.
04768	The first few days will determine whether she can survive.
04769	No-one in the passenger train was hurt.
04770	The investment will be in the food.
04771	In the end we made too many errors.
04772	It was won on the issue of the land.
04773	Pupils will be the losers.
04774	It would be great to reward the Scottish public with a win.
04775	They have to come clean.
04776	The temperature in the town is very difficult to control.
04777	I never wanted a legal battle.
04778	Next time round, it will be different.
04779	It is the quality of the work that counts.
04780	There is no mandate for a regime change.
04781	However, she did not report the matter to the police.
04782	Nobody in Scotland has recognised the creative talent involved in this area.
04783	The other businesses were based in Yorkshire and Northern Ireland.
04784	Worry can have that effect on some citizens.
04785	So was the first half.
04786	The decision was blamed on weak investment markets.
04787	It's nice to be involved.
04788	Time is now very short.
04789	The championship is different from the other majors.
04790	We are committed to realising the potential of every child.
04791	Or was it?
04792	Two years later, she was dead.
04793	It is not easy to live in Russia.
04794	It is difficult to comment on the prospects for the year ahead.
04795	This decision was taken with the full support of Scottish ministers.
04796	The defender should have won the bloody ba.
04797	Bombing is the easy option.
04798	We can hardly talk about it.
04799	It was located on the remote control.
04800	The deal is expected to be completed by next summer.
04801	You look like a rugby player.
04802	Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman.
04803	We've got a lot of that sort of nonsense in the North-east.
04804	The whole point is to get the issue into the open.
04805	It should have taken a year for a company this size.
04806	I was delighted with the way he jumped.
04807	An announcement will follow in due course.
04808	I was first in the door.
04809	Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy.
04810	It will always be the highlight of my career.
04811	Its body language is all wrong.
04812	So the Government will be damaged.
04813	I have lost all confidence.
04814	John was there already in spirit.
04815	In the end, it was no choice.
04816	I have decided to stand down from the list.
04817	Action must be taken to slow down the traffic.
04818	We're not an employment agency.
04819	I could not have hoped to run at this level.
04820	The following year was a miserable time for Mr Dewar.
04821	He is married with three children.
04822	Tourists are only concerned with the quality of their experience.
04823	It is the same old story.
04824	Analysts were not surprised at the talks between the companies.
04825	Overall, we are very pleased.
04826	There is a good example in this city.
04827	The key player in this matter is now the Prime Minister.
04828	There is a range of employers.
04829	The value of the merger is still there.
04830	And I repeat, it would be for exposure and money.
04831	Scottish teams have got to take their chances.
04832	This season has been a nightmare.
04833	We have to put pressure on Rangers.
04834	She has a little boy.
04835	I was just happy to get my own goal.
04836	The thing is to recognise that chance.
04837	They have put in a lot of time and effort.
04838	He's in his element and the audience is delighted by him.
04839	He replied that it was a dilemma.
04840	He said the Parliament should be left to make its own decision.
04841	MAN is fully listed on the London Stock Exchange.
04842	We must improve our relations with government.
04843	It was an amazing afternoon.
04844	Once again, they were back amongst the big boys.
04845	I had a tie in my hand.
04846	Today, the story is different.
04847	Head injuries are the leading cause of death.
04848	We have received a number of inquiries from interested parties.
04849	A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed.
04850	But we are severely limited in funds.
04851	Together, we can make a difference.
04852	It is that sort of film.
04853	Mr Reid said the repeal was a sensitive issue.
04854	They recorded their debut album in New York.
04855	Which may be the same thing.
04856	As it turned out it was a triumph.
04857	I can't wait for the season to end.
04858	You have got to be careful.
04859	No decisions have been made in this respect.
04860	No, because it was too many.
04861	I believed that effort was needed in our own area.
04862	The second goal was a terrible mistake by our defence.
04863	He was convicted at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
04864	Legal opinion is that I may have a case.
04865	However, one has arrived in the post.
04866	He looked on the deal as a merger rather than a takeover.
04867	He doesn't like the Labour Party.
04868	It has been a waste of time.
04869	The rest of the business is very robust.
04870	I saw it didn't work.
04871	To tell the truth, it wasn't a good game.
04872	We are over the moon.
04873	It was another reminder of the power of an image.
04874	Tickets will be at a premium.
04875	I just got under the ball a bit.
04876	There is a similar story for milk and dairy products.
04877	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to their home in the sky.
04878	We're only taking on a couple just now.
04879	The local primary is excellent.
04880	It felt right for me.
04881	We are opening an inquiry.
04882	This remains the case.
04883	Certainly, we do as well.
04884	I wish I could see it again.
04885	I am secure in my owns position.
04886	It is a complex deal.
04887	It does not stop here.
04888	We're working on it night and day.
04889	The results, out tomorrow, will focus on the company's strategy.
04890	I only signed this morning.
04891	The Office is a show about nothing, then.
04892	You could very well be.
04893	It is nice to be a woman and a wife.
04894	She always put the party first.
04895	Things have just worked out this way.
04896	He has real potential.
04897	Without doubt, the debate on education is welcome.
04898	Confidence is as low as it can get.
04899	I think with my experience I can help the team.
04900	That is really all.
04901	The deal was done on Wednesday.
04902	The time has arrived for a review.
04903	That is very important.
04904	Maybe they will see sense.
04905	Because I was a very physical person.
04906	They're already booked for next year.
04907	The savings can be dramatic.
04908	However this weekend it will be different.
04909	What is the wife?
04910	His massive advantage was never under threat yesterday.
04911	Two of our crew were killed.
04912	I feel confident about the outcome.
04913	The referee had been right.
04914	Jack was always going to win this one.
04915	You're quite wrong, he said.
04916	I was born for this moment.
04917	You can maintain regular contact.
04918	This makes up for it.
04919	Firm action must be taken.
04920	That's the bit that's wrong.
04921	Nothing would now surprise me.
04922	But I am in practice.
04923	Trading is tough at the moment.
04924	It came a bit late.
04925	All music goes into me.
04926	That was a great performance by the team.
04927	The family moved around a lot.
04928	An announcement is expected within a few months.
04929	These people were my friends.
04930	That will bring about a dramatic improvement.
04931	This commitment should be built upon.
04932	I hope we've reached the bottom now.
04933	However, it's possible that Dick can have influence some Dutch players to go there.
04934	This is a separate announcement which is in a different league.
04935	That comes at a cost.
04936	The truth will come out.
04937	She's been shot.
04938	Their moment had come, or so they said.
04939	It gives a commitment.
04940	Now it was Britain's turn.
04941	No such meeting took place.
04942	It is just too tough.
04943	The options seem limited.
04944	It's been my life.
04945	Everything people said about it was true.
04946	No, but my wife is.
04947	I'm taking each day as it comes.
04948	Now he's back on top again.
04949	No-one wants to talk about death.
04950	Once again, he refused.
04951	We just want this session to end.
04952	Neil has worked hard throughout his career.
04953	The single currency could well lead to a single tax policy.
04954	She runs like her mother.
04955	In short, the national team without Frank is like football without feet.
04956	They were certainly tough, but totally fair.
04957	I saw people on fire.
04958	Both leaders were joined by senior party figures.
04959	He suffered severe head injuries.
04960	It was men against boys.
04961	Henry should go now.
04962	Now we have fresh hope.
04963	IT has been a tough year for Scottish business.
04964	It was all great training.
04965	No partners would lose their jobs.
04966	He talks too much.
04967	Many changes are positive changes.
04968	This is a big game for both of us.
04969	I go home only once.
04970	Progress, however, is only achieved through hard work and heavy investment.
04971	They were game, but not very good.
04972	I did not vote either way.
04973	We really are a team.
04974	I hit you there.
04975	We have brought the staff back on board.
04976	We had a right to expect those days were over.
04977	The group's increasing scale will help.
04978	We were looking for a base.
04979	We had a grand view.
04980	Walker declined to put a figure on losses.
04981	Some changes have been achieved at great cost.
04982	Everyone wanted him to win.
04983	I may play with two players up, maybe not.
04984	Others get through it.
04985	I knew him well.
04986	The third has yet to be named.
04987	He was called in by the government last year to report on pension reform.
04988	Scots police had been asked to join the search to find him.
04989	People realise we have a job to do.
04990	It would be nice to be involved in another victory.
04991	He will get his chances.
04992	She now lives in London.
04993	It's not a small step.
04994	You have made your point.
04995	He died the following year.
04996	Rangers was on the agenda and I am interested.
04997	If so, we want to hear from them.
04998	She doesn't know the half of it.
04999	Perhaps they were right.
05000	Autumn will be a real challenge.
05001	That was around July, August.
05002	It changed the very language.
05003	I did so, making the positive case for Scottish New Labour.
05004	Only one got through.
05005	It's not a marketing scheme.
05006	He left pretty quickly.
05007	The board would report to the Scottish Parliament.
05008	They might surprise themselves.
05009	It is his speed off the mark that is so impressive.
05010	Hibs are playing with style now.
05011	This is extremely positive news.
05012	I just felt like a dead loss.
05013	They really had a go at us.
05014	They should try to get tickets.
05015	The change could come as soon as September.
05016	I can't get away from it.
05017	He had played very well.
05018	It's quite crucial for me.
05019	The regional government faces key elections next May.
05020	Time remains to put other candidates forward.
05021	In Great Britain, it has a life of its own.
05022	This deal is a great boost for the Borders.
05023	An opera company needs to have its orchestra.
05024	I believe they are dead.
05025	We had to approach it the way we feel we can do best.
05026	It looks at public interest issues.
05027	The book is closed.
05028	I would be very keen on a move to Italy.
05029	He is fully fit.
05030	That would concern me lot.
05031	Both watched her win yesterday.
05032	Her father had died recently.
05033	Neil knows the score.
05034	It had been introduced over six years.
05035	It shows we're not much of a rugby country.
05036	Her body has never been found.
05037	The purchase was widely criticised by both analysts and investors.
05038	I would never even consider it.
05039	It has helped focus attention on junior golf.
05040	We've had some pretty bad times.
05041	That is for white people.
05042	Neither had any other career.
05043	Without rules, the elections could not go ahead, he stressed.
05044	I took my chance.
05045	He was always Scottish Labour, or simply Labour.
05046	It would have to look for outside funding.
05047	John gave up everything to be with me.
05048	He had wanted to play, but we had to be responsible about the decision we took.
05049	I have been going through a lot of things.
05050	People could have a post box in the local post office.
05051	If we get a penalty next week I want to take it.
05052	This is too much like Scotland.
05053	His third child was born in April.
05054	They want the style of the sound changed a bit.
05055	Young people will always run away.
05056	The view is impressive.
05057	It is the same with Barry.
05058	The experts got it wrong.
05059	We have done our own tests.
05060	No, because they look good boys.
05061	His deal is effective for two years, starting in July.
05062	We learned two things.
05063	It has been only average.
05064	It was either Wednesday or Thursday, he said.
05065	It was an attitude thing.
05066	But it is her picture.
05067	The tickets are on their way.
05068	He plays only for himself.
05069	They have quick front players, but so do we.
05070	It was that kind of match.
05071	Good records have always been recognised by successful farmers.
05072	So I moved on.
05073	That view was confirmed by Welsh coach Graham Henry.
05074	You took the law into your own hands.
05075	But British scientists were not convinced by the findings.
05076	They like big name players.
05077	Financial services also saw a sharp reduction in new business.
05078	Williams said the same.
05079	I've learned a huge amount from Michael.
05080	A report will be issued by March.
05081	The legislation is expected to be introduced next spring.
05082	We didn't really have to power up.
05083	He is very fast all right.
05084	They could change them tomorrow.
05085	We have some options there.
05086	This man must be helped to keep his arm.
05087	Our performance wasn't perfect.
05088	She had black eyes.
05089	In practice, the economic tests have to be met.
05090	I have to protect them.
05091	The people are nice, though.
05092	Equipment is also a problem.
05093	We cannot ask for them back.
05094	The tie isn't over.
05095	He doesn't need to hit people.
05096	A job is a job, after all.
05097	It all came good.
05098	It was a hard fight.
05099	However, the proposal is not aimed at rugby, but at all sports.
05100	Colin Cameron was excellent.
05101	That approach has passed its sell by date.
05102	Sir George said every company in the country has this issue at the moment.
05103	WE all watch the same match.
05104	We would deal first with the biggest party.
05105	The company was set up six years ago.
05106	The three previous winners also came from Scotland.
05107	Powers looks straight ahead.
05108	The festival runs until Tuesday.
05109	We are unable to provide support for future issues.
05110	These days are past.
05111	The official also said no groups had made any terrorist claims involving the crash.
05112	They finished second and third.
05113	They thought he was asking the right questions.
05114	It had been accepted.
05115	The truth was rather different.
05116	The technology looks excellent.
05117	The party had high hopes of taking the seat from Labour.
05118	They're interested only in profits.
05119	That does not take much training.
05120	Scotland needs this award.
05121	He enjoyed being with his family.
05122	It's a strategy which would work beyond this show.
05123	He dismissed the action.
05124	If they gave me free electricity I still wouldn't support the plans.
05125	It is an industry failure.
05126	Each year they cut them down a bit.
05127	We showed some spirit against Newcastle.
05128	It's a tough old job to get for your first job.
05129	I've got to win here to be happy.
05130	I'm delighted for Andy.
05131	The child has denied murder.
05132	The union has threatened strike action unless these demands are met.
05133	The first four teams were all inside the previous record.
05134	I'd like my TV programmes to be simple, but not too simple.
05135	Your bank may offer you a choice of options.
05136	That is surely worth a try.
05137	I believe in theatre.
05138	The accident seemed so simple.
05139	Her father wasn't best pleased.
05140	We've got good options.
05141	He added that trading data for the new stores would be revealed in due course.
05142	That means a ban on French products.
05143	This is yet another example of double standards from headquarters.
05144	A quality audit officer has also been appointed.
05145	TODAY it begins.
05146	A parliament for England is the only way to redress the balance.
05147	The results are tragic.
05148	The cause of the fire is not yet known.
05149	We are looking for a good performance and a good result.
05150	He deserved the win.
05151	I can leave at the end of the day.
05152	Wealth is relative.
05153	Treatment is aimed at the symptoms.
05154	Surely, if anything, it would be the other way around.
05155	It's very good.
05156	We recorded it at our own expense.
05157	It's good news.
05158	We need a new kind of theatre.
05159	I haven't had a lesson in four years.
05160	O Neill has delivered.
05161	They have now become the focus of a huge police inquiry.
05162	They will be stopped, and they will be punished.
05163	It's a killer piece.
05164	That goes back a long way.
05165	It was very fast.
05166	Spent three months alone at sea.
05167	There was a vacuum.
05168	We lost a boy.
05169	I can give no comment.
05170	We've tried every other way.
05171	Maloney was asked.
05172	But I was knocked out by the city.
05173	He was also a great man.
05174	The task is enormous.
05175	It's like a car crash.
05176	On the contrary, it was actually very funny.
05177	In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds.
05178	It's an absolute nonsense.
05179	I knew the script.
05180	They were kept there for a summer.
05181	In that case, we would be prepared to defend ourselves.
05182	He was really great.
05183	Such as it is.
05184	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows.
05185	He may not need to force that message.
05186	A week is a long time in politics.
05187	It is a different animal.
05188	So I liked the challenge.
05189	That way I won't have to do anything.
05190	It's just the timing of the game.
05191	Her body was found on Monday morning.
05192	A government is a government is a government.
05193	He can win every week.
05194	The cut is excellent news for the consumer.
05195	There was no way back for United after that.
05196	They need to find a form of words.
05197	It's for that reason he should resign.
05198	They were a lovely couple.
05199	Then came the collision with Sergio.
05200	He has done that with a great deal to spare.
05201	I was always a little behind.
05202	We have a training class.
05203	They scored with a penalty and a breakaway.
05204	There was a definite prejudice.
05205	That is not too bad.
05206	We came across the first set of bodies.
05207	We were given a warm and friendly reception.
05208	It is premature to speculate on the impact.
05209	It is not a threat.
05210	I would not count on it.
05211	The referee had a good game.
05212	The European Union is a case in point.
05213	A bit of match fitness is required.
05214	It was a crazy day.
05215	Edinburgh was not included in the survey.
05216	He has been a success this year.
05217	He declined to give any details.
05218	They were back in full training yesterday.
05219	It disappeared into the cup.
05220	A lot of their players have developed in the English league.
05221	We have a plan in place.
05222	He wants to talk a lot.
05223	We will make a statement tomorrow.
05224	I will not be afraid.
05225	He has left the company.
05226	I am not concerned with protection of the public.
05227	People can really get themselves in a mess.
05228	You are looking at him.
05229	This is a source of real concern for the area.
05230	It's not an easy life.
05231	It makes a compelling display.
05232	Some will be deployed on submarines.
05233	It intends to do so on Wednesday.
05234	They have created a business.
05235	They are used to the big stage.
05236	In fact, he was great today.
05237	The results will take second place.
05238	There were no plans for a rights issue.
05239	That's all I can say.
05240	I thought he was an animal.
05241	We will stand for the nation.
05242	Further new equity was raised in a placing in January.
05243	It needs to be volatile.
05244	Nobody should believe this story.
05245	He got very close tonight.
05246	Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses.
05247	Carlton also declined to comment last night.
05248	It's as we were yesterday.
05249	However, the purchase is as yet unproven.
05250	Something has to give sometime.
05251	The latter option was chosen.
05252	The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal.
05253	I knew my contract was up this year.
05254	It was just too much for us.
05255	Debate was impassioned and furious.
05256	I would not say that.
05257	This was a far cry from his election pledges.
05258	The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles.
05259	A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said.
05260	We deserved the three points.
05261	He also had a Scottish grandfather.
05262	He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it.
05263	He's not getting into any games.
05264	It is time for new ways for the church.
05265	I am glad I wasn't in it.
05266	In fact, I have even had a bet on them.
05267	Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday.
05268	They would be supported by visiting specialists.
05269	The ethos of the school was outstanding.
05270	Or so the story goes.
05271	The Breadwinner came home from Africa.
05272	But then they scored their fourth.
05273	The rise in retail sales was the first since August.
05274	I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice.
05275	Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions.
05276	And so the cycle continues.
05277	But the relief was short-lived.
05278	The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost.
05279	We are happy with the referee.
05280	Pressure of work is no excuse.
05281	The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant.
05282	Lee Westwood has other ideas.
05283	Everyone around the club was supportive.
05284	They have inherited the human rights abusers.
05285	McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse.
05286	Don Hutchison, too, is a threat.
05287	However, this concern appears to be misguided.
05288	My players have no idea about football.
05289	He wants to be competing for titles and medals.
05290	Years ago it was really quite simple.
05291	They've got some extremely good players.
05292	There was no basis for their arrest.
05293	Their extinction is not inevitable.
05294	Bin Laden was not mentioned.
05295	The Dutchman was pleased with the result.
05296	The shoppers knew it before City investors did.
05297	The planning appears to have paid off.
05298	They were never seen again by friends or relatives.
05299	In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience.
05300	A more exhaustive analysis is in progress.
05301	A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour.
05302	Luckily, our patient was stable.
05303	But no party would win overall control of Scotland.
05304	Injuries have taken their toll.
05305	When she went off it was quite amazing.
05306	They need to be involved.
05307	It was a lovely sunset.
05308	Life has changed for rugby players in just three years.
05309	It gave me something to focus on.
05310	The only problem was the greens.
05311	Plans were made to expand.
05312	Laura is an investment banker.
05313	I am not ready for Lennox Lewis.
05314	McCall is unlikely to change a winning team.
05315	Weather should not be a factor.
05316	He looked at me before replying.
05317	I have huge respect for him as a journalist.
05318	He added, We are not prepared for war.
05319	David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme.
05320	Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott.
05321	Labour will almost certainly remain in control.
05322	This is a load of nonsense.
05323	It is sending the wrong message to people.
05324	There is no change in principle from the White Paper.
05325	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases.
05326	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows.
05327	It's a winner.
05328	The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed.
05329	It was quite rigorous.
05330	It was a delight on every level.
05331	It's like a football team.
05332	I had been at the Evening Standard for two years.
05333	I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people.
05334	It's a true story.
05335	You can cope with it.
05336	A young Briton had a lucky escape.
05337	If you look at the other galleries in this area.
05338	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning.
05339	He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo.
05340	They will not be allowed to succeed.
05341	It was as if I had been stabbed.
05342	Drugs are a serious problem.
05343	We have to find a way to put that right.
05344	We have made a commitment to those people.
05345	She declined to give the reasons for the decision.
05346	It is not in my nature.
05347	We should recognise that others have done a good job.
05348	But the battle has only just begun.
05349	The new system will be marketed this summer.
05350	I would be prepared to go anywhere.
05351	Its replacement was not used in the exercise.
05352	You were made to feel so welcome.
05353	But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact.
05354	The first half was depressing.
05355	It is not disputed that the driver was at fault.
05356	Scotland came very close in the second Test.
05357	She returned to the theatre.
05358	The outcome is now in our own hands.
05359	I'm pretty happy with the way I played.
05360	Playing in Europe is the benchmark.
05361	For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo.
05362	I know every village and island on the west coast.
05363	In France, the reverse is true.
05364	I am very realistic about these things.
05365	There can be no compromise on that demand.
05366	It would appear to be a good time to invest.
05367	There is no excuse for domestic abuse.
05368	There's a chance they might come down.
05369	Yet the evidence is plain to see.
05370	There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal.
05371	That was a real challenge.
05372	We were a shambles at the back.
05373	Everything depends on the weather.
05374	I was just getting over the time difference.
05375	He could see no other bidder.
05376	The target is to break even by Christmas.
05377	The manager's position was obviously included in that review.
05378	He was overwhelmed by the response.
05379	It would be great to win the title again.
05380	Selection is not in my hands at all.
05381	His day had started much like any other Sunday.
05382	Survival is not an option.
05383	It will set the tone.
05384	It is far too early.
05385	Age is not like other forms of discrimination.
05386	The next week is crucial.
05387	It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
05388	He declined to comment on possible disposals.
05389	This statement has never been withdrawn.
05390	This decision is a farce.
05391	We are satisfied with this outcome.
05392	My mind is focused on the next four weeks.
05393	But the Foreign Secretary can cope.
05394	I came here this week to work.
05395	They knew that I wanted to do something.
05396	Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited.
05397	Last season was very hard for me.
05398	It runs until the beginning of June.
05399	Of course, it is nonsense.
05400	That was a touch of class.
05401	People will see this over time.
05402	This is a huge boost for my confidence.
05403	The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold.
05404	I didn't get to keep it.
05405	It would be very dangerous.
05406	It deserved to be a winner.
05407	It shows the right amount of progress.
05408	It was to be inclusive.
05409	No further details of expansion plans were given.
05410	We expect a rise by the end of the second quarter.
05411	Something happened on that island.
05412	I'm not looking for a breakthrough.
05413	I am an actor.
05414	He should resign.
05415	The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published.
05416	It opened last month.
05417	You have a plan?
05418	That idea is rubbish.
05419	The prison has been affected by unrest in the past.
05420	The court had a number of empty seats.
05421	And he laughs.
05422	Who will provide the wine?
05423	They deserved the win.
05424	But we are a young side.
05425	The package was expected to be launched within the next three months.
05426	He is to appeal.
05427	I'm very grateful.
05428	We have the location, which is assured.
05429	There is no suggestion of any sinister intent on his behalf.
05430	Everything has collapsed.
05431	Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced.
05432	The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society.
05433	We are all equal.
05434	Admission is free.
05435	In it went.
05436	We were used.
05437	Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister.
05438	That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano.
05439	Bill is a mentor.
05440	We are certainly moving in the right direction as a club.
05441	It was ignored.
05442	He's just in it for himself.
05443	Our position remains unchanged.
05444	This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby.
05445	The role of the law lords would be retained.
05446	They should come clean.
05447	We've all had the shots.
05448	They must do it.
05449	He is also keen to win the European order of merit.
05450	I was invited to work in Germany.
05451	It sounded as if it might well be tragic.
05452	He loves the big occasions.
05453	The performance was excellent.
05454	That has been lost.
05455	Is that possible?
05456	What was the difference between them?
05457	These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
05458	It carries a double message.
05459	The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse.
05460	The creditors have lost a lot.
05461	This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst.
05462	It was a family tragedy.
05463	It's not a holiday time for football players.
05464	Got to win today, though.
05465	The pressure is on them.
05466	There's still plenty of time left.
05467	I didn't think so either.
05468	We would make a start.
05469	It feels like a privilege.
05470	We'll have to think about it.
05471	The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer.
05472	Today is not a victory.
05473	I'm not going to answer that right now.
05474	The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance.
05475	He later paid a tribute to his opponent.
05476	That was a problem for me.
05477	They would have to go to the Royal.
05478	It had so much to do with the output.
05479	He said the move followed a downturn in business travel.
05480	This will look at consumer attitudes.
05481	The demand is created by the supply.
05482	Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK.
05483	It was a horrible moment.
05484	was everything done to save the people?
05485	You are talking about a matter of life and death.
05486	Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt.
05487	But it is a slow process.
05488	Other musicians were found in retirement.
05489	It is a terrible state of affairs.
05490	They will have to cut through the roof.
05491	Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow.
05492	The statement finally came on Wednesday night after the market had closed.
05493	Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time.
05494	She's had to suffer for the last six years.
05495	That means that nobody can do it.
05496	Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways.
05497	I can't play the game for them.
05498	We are certainly talking about many millions.
05499	The latter were not from Scotland.
05500	I want the Commonwealth and European titles.
05501	It is the only company of its kind in the UK.
05502	It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies.
05503	I did not concentrate on my performance.
05504	Here the jury is still out.
05505	It was a good game to watch.
05506	It's going to take some time.
05507	I prefer the clarity of the existing system.
05508	The danger is always there.
05509	Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics.
05510	Full back was a bit of the unknown.
05511	They had been forced to walk.
05512	It's not good at all.
05513	They responded well after the run of defeats.
05514	The interim dividend has been passed.
05515	Wilson will tell the truth.
05516	There were no reports of casualties.
05517	The effects are not all bad.
05518	He would not impose a fine.
05519	I couldn't honestly tell you.
05520	My main intention was to write a funny comedy.
05521	It has raised the profile of Scottish banking.
05522	It is a flexible concept.
05523	And we were very lucky.
05524	But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again.
05525	Writing has diminished in value.
05526	That's the way it goes.
05527	No one wants a dispute.
05528	Our season is not finished.
05529	The business model is actually very exciting.
05530	Governments will have to respond.
05531	We are in a global market.
05532	Do not forget about Monaco.
05533	It had been a magical moment.
05534	It will be completed within a year.
05535	The group will also become an Internet service provider.
05536	The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh.
05537	Nobody will be forced to work.
05538	It's just a training thing.
05539	Hopefully, the answer is in the positive.
05540	I was pleased with my own game.
05541	No doubt the council would welcome the proposal.
05542	His message was very simple.
05543	We just thought it would be kept under the carpet.
05544	The answer was up there on the stage.
05545	He will not be involved in school discipline.
05546	There is , according to the legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
05547	Strathclyde police had appealed for witnesses.
05548	Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped him form.
05549	It is a financial matter.
05550	I wouldn't have wanted any other way.
05551	His name was unknown.
05552	Some realism was needed about the time, resources and management.
05553	It's the Tate.
05554	We will treat it like a World Cup match.
05555	That review will look at the management across the sector as a whole.
05556	I could never be cool.
05557	He also insisted that no concession had been made to the French.
05558	Yet, for the money, he was not the man of the match.
05559	Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow.
05560	He's been in a nursing home for two years.
05561	It can help.
05562	I love the thought of having a crack at the defending title.
05563	There were no immediate reports of injuries.
05564	I am extremely cautious.
05565	I want a career.
05566	And they replied.
05567	We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage.
05568	He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism.
05569	A fiver and I'll tell.
05570	I can feel the sound inside.
05571	This is slightly negative for inflation.
05572	Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank.
05573	Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect.
05574	We like being the underdogs.
05575	He confirmed that the document was valid.
05576	The new deal will now be put to the officers.
05577	Webster was brought up in Glasgow.
05578	Funding needs to be long term.
05579	The coach is a man who is very ambitious.
05580	Context is also very important.
05581	People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally.
05582	He's been active in Arabia.
05583	He was unprepared for this fight.
05584	Choice is a good thing.
05585	I am not very pleased.
05586	Cutting ticket prices would certainly help.
05587	Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do.
05588	A good actor doesn't think.
05589	These people are now following their own Unison agenda.
05590	It took five months to repair the damage.
05591	Advice and counselling will be offered.
05592	It was a sobering experience.
05593	That will be the sweetness.
05594	Sacking John Redwood is a disaster.
05595	The feedback from them has been fantastic.
05596	But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles.
05597	It is quite a thing to watch.
05598	Some promoters made insulting offers.
05599	Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands.
05600	I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised.
05601	For business, the benefits will be enormous.
05602	I felt we deserved the three points.
05603	The family kept away from me.
05604	I would have been shot dead in bed.
05605	Sunday's game against Celtic is huge.
05606	And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow.
05607	It's as eventful as it is momentous.
05608	It was horrible, that musical apartheid.
05609	The Government has completely lost control of GM crops.
05610	This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend.
05611	You just have to give yourself a chance.
05612	I grew up with that in the amateur game.
05613	Employees may be taken on at Livingston.
05614	He worked there for six months.
05615	The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel.
05616	Brown has always protested his innocence.
05617	Market research indicates that this is not feasible.
05618	It must be tough to live with.
05619	Six other people were injured.
05620	A, The media has been great.
05621	You didn't need to pay.
05622	The might be rolled out.
05623	They make the right decisions.
05624	I always savour the company of The Voice.
05625	Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland.
05626	He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire.
05627	I might also completely change the routine.
05628	He was due to retire in December.
05629	When I was four years old I used to do like this.
05630	It was very positive and very helpful.
05631	We are having a look.
05632	Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party.
05633	There's been a mistake.
05634	We just got a phone call on Saturday night.
05635	It was little else.
05636	The MoD has denied any cover-up.
05637	It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult.
05638	It won the match.
05639	And it showed.
05640	Who would be in that desert?
05641	The children are fine.
05642	It was a total disaster.
05643	Stewart was the life and soul of the party.
05644	Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates.
05645	If they don't, they should say so.
05646	I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target.
05647	These decisions are not simple.
05648	It was a hell of a way to lose.
05649	This will get their attention.
05650	Well, the climate has changed.
05651	They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible.
05652	The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow.
05653	I'm looking to the future.
05654	He said a change in legislation was long overdue.
05655	We have got a race.
05656	The music industry hasn't changed at all.
05657	Ferguson will be a millionaire.
05658	Others are not so sure.
05659	I have always loved the countryside.
05660	Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray.
05661	On my day I can beat anyone.
05662	I've always been like that.
05663	They are still very quiet.
05664	It was a horrible thing to happen.
05665	A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death.
05666	After his birthday, Scott was very upset.
05667	I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance.
05668	It is not enough to be first division champions.
05669	The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair.
05670	Scottish rugby has given me everything.
05671	You have asked for action.
05672	Much the same thing happens in a young company.
05673	That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board.
05674	The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached.
05675	And he is immensely loyal.
05676	It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive.
05677	He expected a conclusion by next Thursday.
05678	It seemed so personal.
05679	It's too much work.
05680	People should not become complacent.
05681	They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured.
05682	It was hopeless.
05683	It was entirely justified.
05684	It's always nice to play on Centre Court.
05685	Breaking new ground is also very rewarding.
05686	However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work.
05687	You make the choice.
05688	I have been in good form for the last two years.
05689	Nobody even knew it had happened.
05690	In Glasgow, a sheriff dismissed five cases yesterday without hearing evidence.
05691	There was just fire all around me.
05692	It might have led to a screen career, but it didn't.
05693	I think we are back on track.
05694	I think it's a big advantage to us.
05695	There were no hard words between us.
05696	Today he will meet the Italian press but he will give little away.
05697	Every blood test on sheep in Scotland has been completely clear.
05698	These old songs are very nice to play.
05699	My views on the decision are well known.
05700	We were on top and could have won.
05701	Some would say that that culture had been created already.
05702	So it looks like a done deal.
05703	The play was to go straight ahead.
05704	At the core of these issues are real people with real jobs.
05705	It's not going to work out that way.
05706	They've got their own agenda.
05707	There's been a wake up call for the sector this week.
05708	The Government should be ashamed.
05709	The standard is extremely high.
05710	It is a real problem.
05711	The players will be down.
05712	There could be a lot of confusion.
05713	Mini rugby is a great thing.
05714	IT is called a killing in the trade.
05715	It's not a lack of confidence.
05716	That is the only way forward.
05717	They are at a very early stage.
05718	There were no serious injuries.
05719	He wants to win a major.
05720	First meeting was next week.
05721	People come from all round the world to see it.
05722	Shareholders may have to wait until June to be paid.
05723	Do not imagine for a moment that they are not there.
05724	And this game is all about belief.
05725	You have got to look at speed of response.
05726	We're very unhappy about it.
05727	This is the year of the Tiger.
05728	That is still in place.
05729	The pig industry is on its knees.
05730	That would depend on the parole board.
05731	He looked like a schoolboy.
05732	England could only play the other team on the park.
05733	For him then it's a labour of love.
05734	This is the correct decision.
05735	He added that the business was in good shape.
05736	We are not doing the Today programme.
05737	There should be room for creative dissent.
05738	The real issue is personal.
05739	Their condition was described as stable yesterday.
05740	This may be perfectly innocent.
05741	There is no shortage of farmers.
05742	But the Farmer is bemused.
05743	It's just the way I play.
05744	It will now be unveiled in the US in July.
05745	I think this proposal is excellent.
05746	He deserves a top team.
05747	It is all about having physical evidence.
05748	I said she was very young.
05749	There will be no final dividend.
05750	The shares are a strong hold.
05751	There was a thing in front of the camera.
05752	He has an equity stake in the investment house.
05753	Our policy is very clear on this issue.
05754	We have to reinforce the pressure on Iraq.
05755	He had returned to die.
05756	It was the same expression of joy.
05757	That is a personal matter.
05758	Footballers have also been targeted.
05759	The professor is in no doubt.
05760	We might be back next year.
05761	It was support as it should be.
05762	It is never easy to win an Olympic gold medal.
05763	THE boy in The Sixth Sense is not alone.
05764	We're all paying for it.
05765	We could hardly believe it.
05766	The men are very worried.
05767	Both promotions come as no surprise.
05768	We are going through the process.
05769	It must never be seen as second class.
05770	It also opened a branch in Livingston.
05771	I would say the position is open.
05772	Inspiring public confidence is crucial.
05773	It is very special for me.
05774	I'd like to see the business case.
05775	You have to respect the office.
05776	It really was an unusual award.
05777	It's been a long wait.
05778	There is no credible official announcement.
05779	From it emerged a cup.
05780	Last night, the row continued.
05781	We are entirely happy with Russell.
05782	It's not a U-turn at all.
05783	I'm sure this game will be equally successful.
05784	It will be retained as part of the group.
05785	Today I had no failures in my team.
05786	The research was my life.
05787	The suspension of the head teacher has been lifted.
05788	The expansion will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank.
05789	She was married with one son.
05790	A copy of the report will be sent to the them.
05791	We are not making any comment.
05792	I will work on her.
05793	Consumers have the right to choose.
05794	These will take a little time to develop.
05795	This is an exciting time for the party.
05796	The problem was you thought you were a big man.
05797	Our future is in their hands.
05798	She claimed the day was for young people.
05799	That takes a lot of courage.
05800	We need to establish the facts.
05801	My office is down there.
05802	They are very keen to work with us.
05803	The next month is very important.
05804	This is a total mystery.
05805	It is the end of an adventure.
05806	It further expressed his defiance.
05807	He said he was sorry.
05808	The Project is far from that.
05809	No final decision has been taken.
05810	In Europe, it is always over two games.
05811	But I think it's different from the rest!
05812	It is a matter of clarity.
05813	He did that every night I was with him.
05814	Another reason is a shortage of stock.
05815	My life is exactly the same.
05816	Last weekend he was awful.
05817	Ferguson is a good example.
05818	That can be good for us.
05819	But the main issue will be the sale of Burger King.
05820	I could not live with it.
05821	There is a lack of logic.
05822	I was Scottish on the basis of my family.
05823	Being with me is an honour.
05824	I can almost pretend to be Scottish.
05825	Something has got to give.
05826	If we were offered The Scotsman I would buy it.
05827	I do not see it as some kind of reward.
05828	He was confronted by police.
05829	This morning I got a call from my wife.
05830	Ms Jackson was not present to put her case.
05831	This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue.It's nice to hear.
05832	They believed it worked.
05833	Nato will prevail.
05834	This is the start of our season.
05835	It was an interesting thing to do.
05836	I carried on for him.
05837	My players are special.
05838	Many innocent people will die.
05839	If we lose the doctor it would be the last straw.
05840	It needs a team approach.
05841	The outcome is not in doubt.
05842	It will be an exciting finale to the season without a doubt.
05843	It is a great feeling right now.
05844	I cannot believe this decision.
05845	I'm pleased to get through the opening match.
05846	The firm also has a construction division.
05847	We have a long way to go this week.
05848	His son is a local legend.
05849	They are only interested in attacking Labour.
05850	The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction.
05851	These things have not happened by accident.
05852	That will be a problem for later.
05853	It wasn't about one player.
05854	That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance.
05855	It was simply no contest.
05856	He has taken the title for the last two years.
05857	They can go to no other method of fishing.
05858	It gets into the culture.
05859	They were a lovely family.
05860	But he gave no details.
05861	He had no problems with discipline.
05862	The couple had one daughter.
05863	National Farmer's Union of Scotland president Jim Walker welcomed the new proposals.
05864	We make this offer to the parliament.
05865	He was said to be emotionally disturbed.
05866	Dunfermline deserved a goal for their hard work.
05867	The damage has been done.
05868	He was backed by Downing Street.
05869	It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated.
05870	But a solution has been found.
05871	I thought it was an accident.
05872	It is quite a figure.
05873	It depends on the couple.
05874	It has been an amazing day.
05875	Now the plot is perfect.
05876	I've never seen anything like it.
05877	He added that he felt undermined.
05878	It would be the end of farming.
05879	I was impressed with them.
05880	The money needs to go to the front line.
05881	It will clearly be discussed in cabinet.
05882	That shows the strength of the US Tour.
05883	People like to talk about these things.
05884	They might be surprised by the response.
05885	Getting this right is essential.
05886	We have learned a tremendous amount.
05887	The trust was unable to pay the fourth interim dividend.
05888	It was a fairy tale.
05889	Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott appealed for privacy.
05890	There is no evidence for that.
05891	I have signed a contract.
05892	It wasn't a good day for us.
05893	Appointments should be made on merit.
05894	This should include procedures for personal imports.
05895	We knew he was very creative.
05896	SE is well down that road.
05897	The hill farm is owned by the father of the young man.
05898	It was like a vacuum.
05899	My dad is all right.
05900	I decided to take my time.
05901	FIRST, we had the Battle of Britain.
05902	It is a disaster area.
05903	He's got to go.
05904	It's good to start with Judith.
05905	There is no room for error.
05906	It also highlighted some local hero districts.
05907	It is an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
05908	That is not in the interests of anyone or any party.
05909	I would welcome a proper, public discussion on this issue.
05910	The real enemy is in your own back yard.
05911	I was not involved in these discussions.
05912	O, Is he conscious?
05913	Eriksson did his countrymen a disservice.
05914	They are being deported from their homes.
05915	IT IS the last week of rehearsals.
05916	I thought the game was very poor.
05917	I don't expect to be here tomorrow.
05918	Or it's not really for us, if you like.
05919	It was a deceit.
05920	You are in power.
05921	PR will be just one of them.
05922	Everything is obviously in the very early stages.
05923	It is just like the stock market.
05924	And the newspapers were full of it.
05925	I wish the solutions were as easy.
05926	She does not see anything ever changing.
05927	It doesn't come any better than this.
05928	The idea has potential for the future.
05929	That was not due to me.
05930	The racist abuse was terrible.
05931	What is the new religion?
05932	Five officers were injured.
05933	Fewer people are being killed in accidents.
05934	I'm trying not to think about that.
05935	Ms Jackson was not at the meeting.
05936	I find the whole affair disturbing.
05937	One woman refused to sit down.
05938	We're in a state of shock and disbelief.
05939	I was completely knackered.
05940	There are two interests in this woodland.
05941	A killer is also on the loose.
05942	Our approach will be different.
05943	You can see how he made his money.
05944	It's really good, as long as we play well.
05945	We would certainly consider the proposals.
05946	We tend to come good at the end.
05947	His record with England was not good.
05948	Lose, and they would be ridiculed.
05949	I didn't think they would be that stupid.
05950	He was between people and God.
05951	We are just being flooded.
05952	If true, it will be the first sign of dissent.
05953	There were no proposals on the table.
05954	It is true, but it is only part of the issue.
05955	THERE's only one word for it.
05956	It was very full anyway.
05957	That was him under pressure.
05958	I can't believe she is dead.
05959	I was in prison for a year.
05960	Among them is his beloved teacher.
05961	He had a really frustrating time last year.
05962	I am constantly changing my mind.
05963	Ending a tenancy is a last resort.
05964	But he just carried on anyway.
05965	We should be capable of managing it, though.
05966	It was that kind of afternoon.
05967	His presence was very important.
05968	We are pursuing legal action against the government.
05969	He insisted that his staff were too.
05970	Let's see that increase over the years.
05971	That, though, is an old story.
05972	So far this season this approach is working.
05973	I have got a knife.
05974	It was, for me, like a week in heaven.
05975	What did we learn?
05976	On that basis, he would set it aside.
05977	That, however, is the end of the good news.
05978	There could still be some to come forward.
05979	What are they like?
05980	They were back in favour with the SAC.
05981	Together they will attempt to express the whole.
05982	I'm just going to do my best.
05983	At the moment, the success in Germany is good.
05984	They offered to make an investment into it.
05985	We have no knowledge of this.
05986	I was influenced by all of these things.
05987	Is my wife a racist?
05988	This would not be my first choice.
05989	It certainly should not be used too often.
05990	Britain has never had it so good.
05991	We are under no illusions about this.
05992	But the killer remains at large.
05993	Scotland, is an increasing concern for young people.
05994	He is adamant that he is innocent.
05995	What's happening to her?
05996	It was even worse than at home.
05997	I did not understand the dynamics of Scotland.
05998	The plane was in flames
05999	We cannot lose it.
06000	I still think he will win.
06001	Elections would follow in about two years.
06002	I've got to get on with my career.
06003	Now we look forward to it.
06004	I have a great respect for her.
06005	IT takes the biscuit.
06006	You're not going to forget something like that.
06007	They missed the boat and everyone suffers.
06008	This is the root of their problems.
06009	Other forces were, however, at work.
06010	He also has property interests in the country.
06011	That takes time and games and practice.
06012	If only the acting profession was that simple.
06013	It is a new company for Scotland.
06014	We should have gone solo.
06015	It is about the script for me.
06016	You cannot enter the clubhouse.
06017	The president will not be removed from office.
06018	These are serious matters.
06019	Are you all right at the front?
06020	We want to replicate that success.
06021	It was the first time they met.
06022	I was never alone with her, right?
06023	It's a technical demand.
06024	I cannot speak on behalf of the IRA.
06025	This is a very high price.
06026	He is the example for all of us.
06027	There is no way to do this.
06028	Clearly we are looking at this very carefully.
06029	Only one person can claim the credit.
06030	But there was no going back.
06031	Progress is being made but it is slow.
06032	We didn't think anything would happen.
06033	He had come of age.
06034	One of these problems is the railways.
06035	It is a very sad day.
06036	I have nothing to hide.
06037	How can they get one?
06038	Only local people are helping.
06039	We had to work hard for it.
06040	John Lennon is a very large industry.
06041	This is my homeland.
06042	You saw the pain he was in.
06043	Asylum is an entirely different issue to race.
06044	Drugs are always an issue.
06045	Lockerbie has been a terrible disaster for everyone.
06046	It has affected me.
06047	She made no further comment.
06048	I have no conflict with them.
06049	The next one comes up.
06050	She was close to suicide at one stage.
06051	We've got better players here.
06052	We are being realistic about the challenges ahead.
06053	People have no chance of getting out.
06054	I am appalled by this news.
06055	We were extremely arrogant.
06056	I am proud of moments like that.
06057	No-one expected that their parents would stay.
06058	The observer saw no evidence of fighting.
06059	You cannot allow it to go on.
06060	It's up to the defence team.
06061	No means testing will be required.
06062	I don't think that's very fair.
06063	Human beings are always the same.
06064	Then there's the problem of sympathy.
06065	If only he knew himself.
06066	This action could have been avoided.
06067	Anyone else can apply.
06068	This was never a support group.
06069	The first time you read a play.
06070	I was a little surprised.
06071	This is my home town.
06072	That was six years ago.
06073	Nothing can bring back their son.
06074	It is up to us to approve it.
06075	His musicals were very much of their time.
06076	They might well be right.
06077	There is great demand for human cloning.
06078	It starts to get you down.
06079	We didn't play well and will certainly improve.
06080	My life has been turned upside down.
06081	The years of campaigning have been very difficult.
06082	I have played well the past two days.
06083	I said, What was that about?
06084	This could prove a problem.
06085	He is an excellent defender, strong and quick.
06086	His game was complete.
06087	What does she consider her greatest achievement?
06088	I wouldn't have had the abandon.
06089	It should not make the same mistake again.
06090	They loved it and it showed.
06091	However, by then the damage had been done.
06092	As far as Scotland is concerned, he should relax.
06093	Have we not been here before?
06094	Just what we didn't need.
06095	Inquiries are still in an early stage.
06096	It is a very beautiful city.
06097	She added, The sheriff was obviously frustrated.
06098	The company reacted very, very well.
06099	The issues are very intense.
06100	It won't be their last.
06101	I'll tell you honestly.
06102	He should be worried about me.
06103	That never happens in real life.
06104	I feel sorry for anyone coming in here.
06105	That was the gimmick.
06106	He has changed my life forever.
06107	There's a tremendous amount of adventure.
06108	This is his first movie.
06109	He already had had complaints.
06110	For that much we must be grateful.
06111	They are the heroes.
06112	That will be the key to success.
06113	They are in good spirits.
06114	You can't get the experience in Austria.
06115	I wonder if Rangers do that?
06116	I'm going to miss it.
06117	The atmosphere was excellent.
06118	As to rugby, well, no-one knows.
06119	His descent was pathetic.
06120	By now he was very ill with cancer.
06121	But let's not get carried away.
06122	It's only tackling congestion.
06123	We've seen that time and time again.
06124	Friends of the family have given their support.
06125	This means a great deal to the families.
06126	He was always nice to me.
06127	Is he going to look after them?
06128	He had no answer.
06129	Scotland is too small a country for that.
06130	You do that because you want to win.
06131	This is the last chance, and everyone knows it.
06132	They always seem to produce.
06133	He wanted someone young and ambitious.
06134	But everywhere the problems are the same.
06135	It does affect the staff and the prisoners.
06136	The company's in good shape.
06137	He became the focus of surrounding interest.
06138	This country has many challenges.
06139	The best option is to destroy the plants.
06140	I've never had problems with any football managers.
06141	To begin with it looks good.
06142	They are with their father.
06143	The review has been conducted fairly.
06144	They will run in tandem with New Work.
06145	I had to win this race.
06146	And right now, it isn't there.
06147	The overall effect is impressive, but distancing.
06148	The girls are ready to compete.
06149	It gives us something to work on.
06150	It was all too little, too late.
06151	What's the problem with change?
06152	There are moments of silence.
06153	Glasgow is about to enter a new era.
06154	The board of governors must act.
06155	That didn't happen for two reasons.
06156	It is time for a new approach.
06157	Now they have decided to have a rethink.
06158	There's no choice is there?
06159	Does it, Noel?
06160	You can't give in to the vandals.
06161	Glasgow is far from overload.
06162	And does it even matter?
06163	My parents are exhausted.
06164	That's why he is a national treasure.
06165	And how he kept his word.
06166	It's their duty to protect them.
06167	The Cup has come home.
06168	This is a big, big win.
06169	As two candidates are proposed, a vote is taken.
06170	That's an equally important factor.
06171	It is a hard act to follow, the Winning act.
06172	That would have killed the match.
06173	Politics is a tough game.
06174	He is just a wonderful actor.
06175	Billy knew he was attracted to women.
06176	The occasion was a conference on Scottish art.
06177	Such cases are on the increase.
06178	This was not helpful.
06179	The police are not the target.
06180	John Prescott is John Prescott, as the prime minister would say.
06181	But that title is a mistake.
06182	It is not true to Hollywood, nor The Player.
06183	I'd rather have been playing.
06184	Several others were absent.
06185	It is surprising to come back this way.
06186	Life is about people, and how you feel about people.
06187	Could they perhaps be related?
06188	We all thought we were going to die.
06189	I knew she was going to win.
06190	What is the Barnett formula?
06191	A suspicion was not enough.
06192	It will probably be my last, too.
06193	I'm surprised to hear it from Tony.
06194	I am looking forward to this film.
06195	They would not tell us.
06196	The balance is all wrong in this country.
06197	This was dismissed as absolute nonsense.
06198	It is my decision and my decision alone.
06199	A venue was found.
06200	It can happen to you, it can happen to anyone.
06201	He was back to square one.
06202	We didn't get any from his face.
06203	But honestly, there is no need for us to panic.
06204	It's time for a change.
06205	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he's looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
06206	It's not, of course, a concert hall.
06207	All my training is for Athens.
06208	Subs not used, McCulloch.
06209	I asked for a picture and she said, No problem.
06210	There is a lot of heroin about.
06211	There is a growing anger among the group.
06212	I have got to adopt the same approach.
06213	It's a sensible management decision.
06214	Just watch the videos and you'll see it.
06215	I would just like someone to confess.
06216	Sub Not Used, McCormick.
06217	We can be proud of our achievements.
06218	He denied that he was an absentee landlord.
06219	Lothian and Borders Police are also involved.
06220	This is thought to mean sometime next week.
06221	Stealing from the benefits system is no different.
06222	General, You didn't get a modified.
06223	That is our unfinished business.
06224	So they will settle again.
06225	He had other things on his mind.
06226	Why did it take a concerted campaign?
06227	Let us hope so.
06228	A lot of people had to wait, and people still do.
06229	It felt like my support system was leaving.
06230	So the challenge is against ourselves.
06231	You see, my back has gone.
06232	We've had our problems at the club.
06233	His behaviour today has been disgusting.
06234	More than half of the school collapsed.
06235	We also hope to meet the men.
06236	I can live with just the one.
06237	All the people thought that we would die.
06238	Sometimes they come off.
06239	A teacher is, really, about unity.
06240	Our nation has been changed by this event.
06241	However, my position remains the same.
06242	There are plenty examples.
06243	Self control is just one instalment.
06244	It's an hour of the same response.
06245	I could not believe what they were saying.
06246	A hard act to follow, but it is being followed.
06247	Will he be given time?
06248	Beyond that would have been outrageous.
06249	I seem to keep this for the majors.
06250	The lowest increase was recorded in Dundee.
06251	We've been overwhelmed by the response.
06252	But the cost to his health was enormous.
06253	It has been hijacked.
06254	And he's the first to see that, and say that.
06255	They must put them back.
06256	You do have a way out.
06257	Committing suicide is not a criminal offence.
06258	This is not a European Army.
06259	And, also, when he does not have the ball.
06260	I have also been delighted with Stevie.
06261	It was different in the endurance events.
06262	They will now have to justify their position.
06263	It didn't help him, as far as we had seen.
06264	The objective was achieved.
06265	Look at his last couple of records.
06266	There is no musical background in his family.
06267	The cost of war is more than that.
06268	You, the British people, are the boss.
06269	The door is open.
06270	PR for Westminster is their holy grail.
06271	She doesn't know me, know anything about me.
06272	These are long-term investments.
06273	Their conditions are described as serious but stable.
06274	He also wants to play in this game, and that's important.
06275	This is excellent news for Glasgow.
06276	If that is the perception, that has to be addressed.
06277	Next league matches, Motherwell Dunfermline.
06278	Eriksson, though, was having none of it.
06279	The Taliban response was swift.
06280	Saddam Hussein has made the case against himself.
06281	In fact, they should have scored three times.
06282	They have their own interests and techniques.
06283	Well, it was part of our ongoing discussions.
06284	The firm was down and almost out.
06285	Reviving the Scottish Open is one option.
06286	Fifteen minutes later, they were found.
06287	It was very, very difficult for me to look at this.
06288	That is why we are here.
06289	Somehow they got out.
06290	The house was so well alight.
06291	I've been very nervous.
06292	Ireland is also prepared to take in refugees.
06293	However, the second goal was about to be delivered.
06294	The proposals were never taken seriously.
06295	The Treasury denied the claims.
06296	The same goes for McKenna.
06297	Perhaps it should stay there.
06298	You can be sure we will have problems.
06299	Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.
06300	We had to take action to protect them.
06301	We have no idea what caused the derailment.
06302	I think we have a very strong case.
06303	Who would be out there, singing?
06304	It is very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
06305	However, his remarks were heavily qualified.
06306	It's something he has worked very hard on.
06307	Horses have some sense.
06308	Last night, the extent of the damage was emerging.
06309	The only answer is a public inquiry.
06310	However, the great thing is that it doesn't matter.
06311	Darrell was, however, adamant.
06312	The rear of the plane was on fire.
06313	It is physical but it is also good.
06314	It's unfair on her.
06315	So, easy does it.
06316	I just want to enjoy myself.
06317	We are concerned that things should be safe.
06318	At this point we can only speculate.
06319	Family members are at her bedside.
06320	I am very shocked.
06321	The people here are quite reserved.
06322	When will this change?
06323	It has made me feel good.
06324	It's been such a long haul.
06325	This gives us a lot of practice.
06326	Sadly, too, many of them are similar.
06327	Sadly, it took a tragedy to change things.
06328	However, it is believed they were from the Highlands.
06329	Britain hasn't seen it in this way.
06330	The crucial strike was yet to come.
06331	Mrs Taylor is taking legal advice.
06332	Of course we know them, from their work in the theatre.
06333	But Allen is deadly serious.
06334	It's a huge amount.
06335	The fire was falling from the sky.
06336	So he was anxious to try something new.
06337	But he is something special, is he not?
06338	This is simply unjust.
06339	A final decision is expected by Friday.
06340	We will do so again.
06341	We will only move forward.
06342	I'm a bit annoyed.
06343	It ignores the future.
06344	I am just looking to God.
06345	What's the rush?
06346	It would also take time.
06347	Nothing is ruled out.
06348	We owe it to the public of Strathclyde.
06349	He doesn't have to like it, but he must accept it.
06350	His conclusion is upbeat.
06351	Clearly, we could go on like this all day.
06352	The investment programme will deliver these improvements.
06353	Pitt, of course, would play the lead singer.
06354	I'm just gonna hit the shot.
06355	He will not be carrying out any surgery.
06356	The replacements made a big difference.
06357	We expect to come through on Thursday.
06358	A web site's planned for November.
06359	He didn't know it was his audition, but it was.
06360	He is, indeed, the grandson of travelling folk.
06361	It will take some time to establish.
06362	Sadly the jury were not convinced.
06363	We never got off the bus.
06364	The report will be launched in Glasgow today.
06365	These will be finally corrected by next week.
06366	We had no idea that this letter existed.
06367	I think in three dimensions.
06368	Three others were wounded.
06369	They had four children together.
06370	It's a way of making a mark.
06371	There is a great carry over value.
06372	Life, as many people know it, in other words.
06373	That was my own personal decision.
06374	She returned home a few days later.
06375	I have been here for only three months.
06376	So what's wrong with Scotland?
06377	She had been in Germany for medical treatment.
06378	How can they engage with the work?
06379	He doesn't need to be told, he knows the truth.
06380	She is fulfilled by it.
06381	But one shouldn't go by that.
06382	Nobody has been put on trial.
06383	Also, he was flawed.
06384	That's why he plays for Scotland.
06385	I just could not cope.
06386	They may differ on other issues.
06387	In short, the club was broke.
06388	There is no dispute with the Iraqi people.
06389	That fight begins today for freedom and liberty.
06390	Is it the players, or is it the coaches?
06391	Apart from that, they would not be making any comment.
06392	The Commons is too outdated.
06393	We have got a full house tonight.
06394	It was not the greatest performance, but it was effective.
06395	It's been quite a turnaround for Miami.
06396	Our children are our future.
06397	It's part of your life.
06398	I was furious about it.
06399	They were not doing it too well, either.
06400	It is typical of me.
06401	There are two offerings from Scotland.
06402	I know you went back this morning.
06403	It has, however, been a long time coming.
06404	This avalanche is just beginning.
06405	That, however, is only part of their story.
06406	Yesterday her family were too upset to speak.
06407	I was living with my mum.
06408	We very much regret that it has occurred.
06409	The whole process was so different.
06410	They feel it belongs to them.
06411	I don't know why she is not here.
06412	They certainly do not socialise.
06413	Police have refused to name the couple involved.
06414	They have got their position, we have got our position.
06415	There was still more disquiet in Israel.
06416	We told them in June.
06417	I'm sure that clubs will all be delighted.
06418	It was just another race, and yesterday is history.
06419	We remain committed to it, as does the government.
06420	But they will not be compelled to join.
06421	It will vote with the US.
06422	There will be no disruption to teaching.
06423	Sergio was talking his chances down yesterday.
06424	No, we had nothing to do with the Jews.
06425	Again the verdict was not proven.
06426	We've just got to work a bit better.
06427	The likelihood is that it will be negative.
06428	That suggests that out fitness is good.
06429	But she's also beautiful behind the face.
06430	Four had been brought down.
06431	The British public is nothing if not fickle.
06432	Such adjustments have been the salvation of United.
06433	We will build upon the basic state pension.
06434	Last year, however, was a different story.
06435	I'm confident we can turn things around.
06436	Tomorrow we begin again as New Yorkers.
06437	Frankly, they have to crack down.
06438	Eleven events are required.
06439	The ministers are now to make their decision.
06440	That's just the kind of thing we have.
06441	I bought a car at auction.
06442	You've gotten all the facts.
06443	It possibly depends on the position.
06444	Life is too short.
06445	What is the Working Families Tax Credit?
06446	The event has now gone to Helsinki.
06447	He's very young but he is growing up.
06448	He is in charge on the pitch.
06449	Detectives are waiting to interview the men.
06450	SOMETIMES, it's not what you say that counts.
06451	For his opposite number, this was a just triumph.
06452	They had asked not to be named.
06453	Well, until recently he didn't think so.
06454	A whole range of factors are involved.
06455	There may be some work in construction, but not enough.
06456	They would love to do more films.
06457	I have great sympathy with these people.
06458	It raises a serious question mark.
06459	He is dying from cancer.
06460	The package has been properly costed.
06461	The attitude and commitment was decent.
06462	The feeling is awesome.
06463	He quit in October.
06464	The family also declined to discuss the case.
06465	Famously, though, there was a catch.
06466	Barry will be able to handle this.
06467	Failure is a curious concept.
06468	But it can happen for Tiger.
06469	Patients will be partners in decision making.
06470	We're very excited and challenged by the project.
06471	The science is well known, the solution is simple.
06472	The initial reaction was disbelief.
06473	All these things have an impact.
06474	For some, it might not make too much difference.
06475	I now know that from memory.
06476	I felt we had fallen back a little.
06477	He doesn't even know who he is.
06478	This is our chance in Northern Ireland.
06479	Hopefully, the goals will return on Wednesday.
06480	The men are safe and unharmed.
06481	I don't know what we're doing wrong.
06482	I can't wait for the outdoors.
06483	It didn't work against Sweden, but that was the intention.
06484	His arguments were supported by Mr Bevan.
06485	But it was to no avail.
06486	I don't think the referees are against us.
06487	The whole experience has left me bitter.
06488	It is not a road of life.
06489	This must be kept in total perspective.
06490	It is three years at present.
06491	My husband was fighting for his life.
06492	As often as not, the cause remains a mystery.
06493	When he took over it really took off.
06494	A contractor was due to be appointed yesterday.
06495	The penalty was the turning point.
06496	I have chosen to do this research.
06497	Michael's putting on a brave face.
06498	This isn't something the Labour Government has invented.
06499	I am sure that this will happen again.
06500	He is very unlikely to feature against Ireland.
06501	All were within range of Israeli cities.
06502	I do not believe they are.
06503	The aircraft was totally destroyed.
06504	What happens when the funding is exhausted.
06505	She's the runner - she makes the decisions.
06506	This is a completely new experience for me.
06507	I should never have come over to Fife.
06508	What kind of person is he?
06509	Their bid was a very good one.
06510	Green is desperate to play in The Open.
06511	And this tournament will travel.
06512	Since then physicists have found that it's not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
06513	They were the better team on the night.
06514	The show is sold out, like the others in the run.
06515	It means we have to have some patience.
06516	I was pregnant and very worried.
06517	I am delighted at Murray's appointment.
06518	A neighbour said the street was shocked.
06519	Michael, he is running!
06520	He was taken to hospital, but later died.
06521	Their ambition is to go back.
06522	My view has now changed completely.
06523	I've been dying for an hour.
06524	We're playing away from home and that's it.
06525	I'm wondering what you feel about the youngest.
06526	They tend to be female and retired.
06527	This was no accident.
06528	I'm really looking forward to seeing the fight.
06529	We've all done it!
06530	Hopefully, that'll come from someone on our side.
06531	The course record was in his name.
06532	What is the point of jailing him?
06533	We should not bring him into a dispute.
06534	This is a possible way forward.
06535	I am not here to get even.
06536	Freedom from Serbia is a growing objective.
06537	We are only human.
06538	I went with the mood.
06539	Debate is not just talk.
06540	How is he enjoying life as a senior?
06541	People remember the Tories in office.
06542	What kind of inclusion is that?
06543	I fell in love with it right away.
06544	Domestic abuse is related to power and control.
06545	I don't have any answer for them.
06546	It took about five or six hours.
06547	I found the course inspiring.
06548	This is the real thing now.
06549	It will not be a long campaign.
06550	Subs not used, McGraw.
06551	Three bystanders were killed.
06552	One policeman was killed.
06553	They could not have done more for me.
06554	That was enough for the committee.
06555	It is a very genuine prospect.
06556	It is the tip of the iceberg.
06557	We have to focus on what is important.
06558	They have to work so hard.
06559	It's not very pretty, but it's effective.
06560	Seven British members of the club are missing.
06561	He had just returned from a run.
06562	There's a strong involvement.
06563	But now it's back to golf.
06564	Was it a signal?
06565	It may not even be possible.
06566	In fact, they go hand in hand.
06567	I gave him a way out, and he took it.
06568	You should have let it write the cards.
06569	It's annoying in a way.
06570	I asked to take it up to Glasgow.
06571	The other conditions were not specified.
06572	I've never felt affection for Emu.
06573	That's not part of the deal.
06574	That was the context of his remarks.
06575	This has gone on too long.
06576	We have great confidence in Derek.
06577	My ambition is to tell a good story.
06578	I don't know the nature of the illness.
06579	The industry will try to get round it.
06580	Who will deliver more service to Scotland?
06581	I want to make a vigorous defence.
06582	And she got it.
06583	We are the weakest link.
06584	We have now no choice.
06585	My father and mother are.
06586	We don't know what happened after.
06587	Did he just want to be on telly?
06588	We have very real concerns about it.
06589	He has gone through the process before.
06590	I can't speak for him.
06591	They were married in Edinburgh last summer.
06592	I can't see him reversing that.
06593	I'm deeply sorry they did.
06594	I have had a wonderful career.
06595	It seemed to have direction.
06596	This takes the pressure off.
06597	Above all, the approach is upbeat.
06598	It was a hugely popular decision.
06599	He invented the language.
06600	Where are they?
06601	It's hard not to.
06602	It is a question of life and death.
06603	However, there are no plans for injecting rooms.
06604	She was always a quality act.
06605	We are all very proud of her.
06606	I'm sure that is not.
06607	It's a great idea.
06608	It's like a score in some ways.
06609	It's a wonderful piece of water.
06610	Therein lies the problem.
06611	We are well insured.
06612	I was quietly confident about getting the win.
06613	You've been working for four years.
06614	There is no shortage of commitment.
06615	He also admitted.
06616	There was no change in the strategy.
06617	It had until tomorrow to comply.
06618	Genetic assessment is crucial.
06619	I enjoy my work.
06620	We have managed to get it under control.
06621	We have a genuine budget in place.
06622	Art is still a risky investment.
06623	These things can happen.
06624	You have to go to the edges.
06625	I'm looking forward to facing the Irishmen.
06626	Harry will be up for it.
06627	He could tell you.
06628	He was, indeed, a thoroughly decent man.
06629	A decision is expected in September.
06630	I want my mum.
06631	The First Minister is an addict.
06632	Its role is not to interfere.
06633	It is becoming a bit of a habit.
06634	You can't believe a word.
06635	You can't get a mortgage.
06636	It is misleading to compare the two.
06637	He said nothing to waiting journalists.
06638	O Leary was clearly disgusted.
06639	That's been the case for a while.
06640	When it is ready, it will be signed.
06641	All options are on the table.
06642	We now have a moment of hope.
06643	Our traditions and cultures remain the same.
06644	The first eviction takes place on Sunday.
06645	This club is perfect for me.
06646	And do you know, it just wasn't the same.
06647	This came as no great surprise to anyone.
06648	I love this job.
06649	I have no secrets.
06650	We are very, very pleased with the response.
06651	We're very, very excited.
06652	It's not a question of talking.
06653	Then they killed another three.
06654	We are not a retailer, we provide a service.
06655	The six others were injured.
06656	They are not the answer to staff shortages.
06657	It should be a pretty exciting session.
06658	Gas is too expensive.
06659	Are we going mainstream?
06660	Who will run the bigger show?
06661	I'm not a little girl.
06662	We have seen the future, and it is different.
06663	Who does he think will win?
06664	We're talking about one or two years.
06665	I just have to accept that.
06666	They will do nothing for the local people.
06667	Do it for us now.
06668	We got the guarantee.
06669	I couldn't have asked for better.
06670	That is however, the only part of the story.
06671	But happily, the story is true.
06672	They are not suitable.
06673	Some days are different from others.
06674	Everything else is the same.
06675	There are no excuses left for us.
06676	His director of football is leaving.
06677	We don't want to be too intrusive.
06678	Their own instinctive response was confirmed.
06679	There are still some matters to be discussed.
06680	This would give Scotland around eight members.
06681	I get on him, he gets on me.
06682	They are in care for a reason.
06683	I haven't a clue.
06684	It has certainly not been an enjoyable experience.
06685	I thought he was terrific.
06686	A statement is expected in April.
06687	This will have no effect on the championship.
06688	We didn't turn it into the inspectors.
06689	I would love to travel with it.
06690	It is a common condition in children.
06691	We will work through the night.
06692	I also thought, This is a feature film.
06693	For now, they have gone as far as they can.
06694	It's as simple as that.
06695	We've been here before.
06696	Neither of them was badly hurt.
06697	From there, it was a success story.
06698	It is a very disturbing picture for men.
06699	I have come here to fight the boxer, not the fans.
06700	I've never seen them down here.
06701	This is our unfinished business.
06702	He had asked if they had the script.
06703	This could take a few days.
06704	A great deal was achieved.
06705	So it was sad.
06706	It's a blunt instrument anyway.
06707	There did not need to be a miracle.
06708	This could also affect the sentencing.
06709	That case has still not been settled.
06710	What do they do, anyway?
06711	They've got a mountain to climb.
06712	It just would not work.
06713	The acting left a lot to be desired.
06714	We started from scratch.
06715	There was no happiness.
06716	Everything is so commercial.
06717	Could it have been better spent?
06718	If that is the case, it is a breakthrough.
06719	The order went out.
06720	Cinema is a communal experience.
06721	The appeal is impartial.
06722	You could see he was thinking about it.
06723	He added, We are full of anger.
06724	They have nowhere else to go.
06725	However, it seems that he got it wrong.
06726	The document is a starting point for discussion.
06727	We all make mistakes.
06728	It didn't put me off.
06729	Now they have found out the truth.
06730	We know we have done wrong.
06731	I wanted to drop out.
06732	I told you so.
06733	He's a good player, but he's not the only one.
06734	Which is where the manager comes in.
06735	Is that what people we want?
06736	There are so many unanswered questions.
06737	Then it was into a series of classes.
06738	He wants to play in the Champions League.
06739	The need for further investment is obvious.
06740	Iraq has no interest in war.
06741	It's hard, but we have had so much to do.
06742	Holiday was certainly no stranger to bigotry.
06743	No-one else was hurt.
06744	What's it for?
06745	Downing Street defended the scale of the awards.
06746	Anything can happen - at any moment.
06747	She is an imposing presence.
06748	There are moments of joy in politics.
06749	Where are you taking her?
06750	It's just not our biggest problem.
06751	The result could be all down to turnout.
06752	I'm not going to change from it.
06753	There were no violations.
06754	That was the type of man he was.
06755	They are not falling now.
06756	We didn't mean to kill him.
06757	The support of Britain is assumed.
06758	So far he has not done so.
06759	He completely loses control.
06760	No decision on that was taken.
06761	The trial continues today.
06762	Europe is a bonus.
06763	It is also used to buy coffins.
06764	Such debate is pointless.
06765	Cooking is intricate and complex.
06766	He found it very hard to understand.
06767	But it would change the context.
06768	But who was driving it?
06769	But opponents were quick to criticise.
06770	We also have had to work the dark side, if you will.
06771	Social workers are on stand-by to help.
06772	Certainly, there is much on the agenda.
06773	He edited the press release.
06774	Visitors were also impressed.
06775	Are there muscular problems?
06776	We had our chances.
06777	However, many questions remained unanswered.
06778	I told her, and she was extremely grateful.
06779	But what is?
06780	Calvin was back at his best today.
06781	My mind was made up.
06782	The council's concern is very simple.
06783	Rangers didn't turn up, by the way.
06784	No other vehicle was involved in the accident.
06785	It's very simple, no-one is forced to compete.
06786	Of course, it doesn't all come off.
06787	He promised a final decision within a fortnight.
06788	The pair are no strangers to smashing records.
06789	It's a tragedy for the area.
06790	It was very well received.
06791	I don't think there's going to be one.
06792	Such is the ego involved.
06793	It raises the edge.
06794	It was not known to myself.
06795	Would it really be good to shorten it?
06796	I don't entirely buy that.
06797	England could not take anything for granted, however.
06798	I saw it in a different way.
06799	Or, rather, it isn't.
06800	Mr Blunkett was convinced.
06801	The auction will be held tomorrow.
06802	He died at the hands of his captors.
06803	It has never been worthwhile.
06804	She was on the edge of breaking point.
06805	It has been supremely successful.
06806	Thankfully, that doesn't happen that often.
06807	Three other people were treated for minor injuries.
06808	We thought we would never see them again.
06809	After that, it's a step into the unknown.
06810	She asked me for the appointment with me.
06811	He must not be removed from office.
06812	I think he was nervous to begin with.
06813	Our children are the future of our society.
06814	I'm sure he would love it.
06815	A final agreement has not yet been completed.
06816	It is just like any other club.
06817	I'm sure he didn't mean it.
06818	We are going to New Broomfield to win.
06819	He declined to give further details.
06820	I think it was entirely the right decision.
06821	Broadcasting will be top of the agenda.
06822	For sure we want to win it.
06823	There was only one problem, the teacher was still there!
06824	He is helping police with their inquiries.
06825	A formal decision will be announced within months.
06826	I knew there was a challenge for me.
06827	I just have no maternal instincts.
06828	If you're going to do it, do it right.
06829	They have a car and cannot afford another.
06830	It is, after all, a very funny play.
06831	Can you imagine a world without design?
06832	And he listens to his artists as well.
06833	I really couldn't believe it had actually happened.
06834	SO now we know the secret.
06835	He's right up to a point.
06836	We would have looked out for each other.
06837	I had no choice but to leave.
06838	Where does he go from here?
06839	Lothian and Borders police are appealing for witnesses.
06840	This time, there were no such rewards.
06841	He said, My own position is quite simple.
06842	But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
06843	It has to find out what went wrong.
06844	People are already enjoying it.
06845	We're just delighted to be back on top.
06846	Or is it the European approach?
06847	I had found my vision.
06848	We are very hopeful he will be cleared.
06849	It is giving out the wrong message.
06850	As a nation, we must become more active.
06851	Nothing has changed from the season before.
06852	I'm not thinking too much about the tour.
06853	We recognise it as a key area.
06854	The mood was euphoric.
06855	The time of judgment has arrived.
06856	Mind you, it wouldn't be a bad idea.
06857	You can take it almost anywhere and practise.
06858	We want to be separate from our neighbours.
06859	Have you heard anything from Paramount?
06860	This has been a terrible experience.
06861	He had a different agenda entirely.
06862	Casualties are a problem for the Kremlin.
06863	That's a lot of bodies to tolerate.
06864	It is reform in return for resources.
06865	It offers a different viewpoint.
06866	The band was good, and it's been a great day.
06867	I haven't enjoyed the last couple of years.
06868	I have no plans to retire.
06869	The Scots are, however, in good company.
06870	There were far more pressing matters to consider.
06871	The whole thing in general is moving on.
06872	This is a test of our character.
06873	They were outstanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
06874	It is, however, an unlikely outcome.
06875	The look on his face was something special.
06876	You have a very persuasive president.
06877	Sure, we have problems.
06878	Axis itself was created from that exercise.
06879	Obviously, people are worried in the West Midlands.
06880	I can't see myself in one of those.
06881	I wondered about changing back to rugby.
06882	He added, We have the same desire.
06883	I got very, very tired.
06884	What did you learn in school today?
06885	He certainly didn't say he was a journalist.
06886	He's working hard on that right now.
06887	I can't say that this is very usual.
06888	We opened up and everything was gone.
06889	However, everyone should do it once in their life.
06890	We are right at the heart of Europe.
06891	I remember it clearly.
06892	I'm sure they will be very happy.
06893	We must get the three points.
06894	There has been a fair bit in between, too.
06895	I feel alive and good today.
06896	We're in England for the time being.
06897	David Trimble has sold out.
06898	Everyone is taking a breath and waiting.
06899	The voters are our masters.
06900	This is great news - a wonderful addition to the programme.
06901	He is willing to pay the required amount.
06902	That's probably the hard bit about being dropped.
06903	The story was being repeated across Scotland.
06904	The driver was unhurt.
06905	Anything that can be done, the Government will do.
06906	There's nothing new in that argument.
06907	Pity he couldn't produce a winning British team.
06908	That's when you hope to take advantage.
06909	The deadline is real and absolute.
06910	I'm sure it will go on.
06911	He was born in London of Scottish parents.
06912	She is still very poorly.
06913	That's how he did the damage.
06914	He added, It is all about the search for power.
06915	If we live forever, can we really be said to live?
06916	Defeat is simply not an option.
06917	We have all been there at some point.
06918	If they don't want to read it, they don't have to.
06919	At least two women were among those arrested.
06920	My intentions are to go on like this.
06921	It is not attempting to offer a solution.
06922	She didn't tell me anything the night before.
06923	I will be having talks with the workforce.
06924	It's like an extension of your body.
06925	Last night they were being comforted by relatives.
06926	We need to know more about her.
06927	And what is she escaping from?
06928	Leaving the Labour Party is one thing.
06929	What happened in this instance is serious misconduct.
06930	I don't know how they make the weight.
06931	She is also claiming constructive and unfair dismissal.
06932	I'm very tired, but it was worth it.
06933	This is the best moment of my career.
06934	Why is he not fighting for the Union?
06935	Parole is a decision for me.
06936	We don't have any senior players.
06937	Not so, it transpires.
06938	Knowledge is everything at this level.
06939	His father and mother are in film production.
06940	It's about attitudes to change.
06941	We have seen the failure of politics.
06942	The party will make up its own mind.
06943	I am very sorry to hear about this.
06944	I'm delighted, and the players were brilliant.
06945	Hopefully we can put in a performance.
06946	When he came to see me on Monday.
06947	Next league matches, Dundee United - Motherwell.
06948	Here, the fans have been fantastic.
06949	It is like a theatre of the absurd.
06950	What kind of festival is proposed?
06951	In my experience, he does not do that.
06952	We're all involved in creating the work.
06953	When we started the album.
06954	Controllers major concern is safety.
06955	This is your country.
06956	That's the most important thing for me.
06957	But it was the sensible thing to do.
06958	I think it'll be a great occasion.
06959	The committees are due to report next year.
06960	It was seriously unpleasant.
06961	What was the cause of all this outrage?
06962	Now, she has completed a family tradition.
06963	The bombing has had a huge influence.
06964	It may be down, but New York is not out.
06965	Manchester United are the classic example.
06966	I've never regretted my decision.
06967	Surely it can't get any worse.
06968	He's in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
06969	We still have a long, long way to go.
06970	He preferred to concentrate on the positive.
06971	The Old Firm are going nowhere.
06972	I'm not sure.
06973	But the championship is not over yet.
06974	WE live in a world of large numbers.
06975	Agents and coaches must be paid.
06976	Charges against the pair were found not proven.
06977	Anyone can still win this tournament.
06978	You're going to die.
06979	We're not really commenting on that.
06980	Ferguson is not interested in the finances.
06981	It was not being marketed properly.
06982	They know their son was murdered.
06983	I love this tournament.
06984	We're all going to take a holiday.
06985	This is your chance.
06986	They told him to go to drama school.
06987	The quality of life is difficult for them.
06988	I think they are right to be impatient.
06989	This year it will be Billy Crystal.
06990	The attack was totally out of the blue.
06991	It's a member of your family.
06992	There's a good chance of seeing something.
06993	We were in different places, usually in cellars.
06994	Thirteen people will be made redundant.
06995	This was the performance, and the result they needed.
06996	It will not work in our favour.
06997	We're very close to making it in Europe.
06998	It was hugely popular decision.
06999	The decision was left entirely to him.
07000	They have been contrasting years, certainly.
07001	These findings are vitally important.
07002	That's always the case, isn't it?
07003	I certainly think it should be there.
07004	I'm sure that they will learn.
07005	His commitment, on the other hand, is clear.
07006	If he could have prevented it happening, he would have.
07007	This time, however, may have been different.
07008	However, that could alter following the latest case.
07009	The last few weeks have been really bad.
07010	I believe in public services.
07011	The atmosphere is businesslike.
07012	Tyson said he had made a mistake.
07013	Four years is a long time.
07014	This process of attrition is expected to continue.
07015	You'll get on like a house on fire.
07016	All inquiries should be made to the police.
07017	Worse still, it can be infectious.
07018	They are a perfectly good thing in principle.
07019	He is very much in our thoughts.
07020	So what could be better than becoming captain?
07021	Our Great Depression is our lives.
07022	He was elected as a councillor last year.
07023	You are always aware of the injury potential.
07024	But that is entirely a matter for them.
07025	But everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
07026	One Minister said the reports were bizarre.
07027	You're not going to get hurt.
07028	But no decision has been made.
07029	Our traditions and culture remain the same.
07030	I decided not to renew the contract.
07031	For us, that decision was hard to understand.
07032	There are so many artists working in Glasgow.
07033	She makes me feel very proud.
07034	He had been surprised by the local reaction.
07035	The voices told me to do it.
07036	A spokesman refused to confirm the figure.
07037	I'm astonished by this decision.
07038	Surely the answer is yes.
07039	I could go on, but none of these things is true.
07040	That sort of thing is long gone.
07041	Our proposals are fully costed.
07042	We all started running forward.
07043	We did not want an absentee landlord.
07044	That, however, is only part of the story.
07045	Things were not easy from the outset.
07046	The team is in division one in Spain.
07047	Our position is not a logic of war.
07048	I have played really well all year.
07049	However, the referee was not in the giving vein.
07050	It was visibly on fire.
07051	It was a fiery game.
07052	That is European law.
07053	It was very lucky no-one was killed.
07054	He's close friend of Gordon Brown.
07055	That is not a position they enjoy.
07056	We wanted to run away with her.
07057	I am not retiring.
07058	I didn't want to ignore the punters.
07059	To me, it was just a miracle.
07060	After that, though, we are still waiting to see.
07061	That can happen so easily.
07062	This is a really serious issue.
07063	How do we get more people in?
07064	Scotland needs to hear it, too.
07065	There is too much at stake for that.
07066	We suspect he was pleased.
07067	Everything is surrounded by confusion.
07068	But, of course, it isn't.
07069	We are almost at that point, but not quite.
07070	I have to say, for me, the game was not.
07071	There is still the question of his health.
07072	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say that he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
07073	Since then physicists have found that it is not a reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
07074	But it's been kept to a minimum.
07075	We have gone on about him no end.
07076	And the art of performance is taking risks.
07077	I feel strongly about it.
07078	I started on fire a couple of times.
07079	Jack McConnell will be making a statement tomorrow.
07080	In the meantime, everyone is taking everyone to court.
07081	Her mother said, She didn't look very well at all.
07082	I am writing a novel.
07083	Sure the COE is a cracking band.
07084	He, too, was unlucky not to get a goal.
07085	Except for this, it was offside.
07086	What do we do for an encore?
07087	Things start to talk to each other.
07088	I would like to stay with Rangers.
07089	From our point of view, it's the right time.
07090	The tribunal continues today.
07091	Basically, the classical tradition won out.
07092	It obviously changes the prospects for getting agreement.
07093	Nobody can get at them there.
07094	It's not only my respect for them.
07095	BIG Brother is listening to you.
07096	We will be paying agency rates.
07097	In the end, however, it all came together.
07098	They can be time consuming.
07099	It's a depressing, difficult and demanding job.
07100	Subtle it is not.
07101	If they don't, they can expect their funding to be cut.
07102	Raised the way you want it.
07103	Football is very easy, you have to work for the team.
07104	Then he did it twice.
07105	We were short of athletes.
07106	Its first awards will do just that.
07107	It was the crowning point of my career.
07108	That's how she wants to remember him.
07109	Do something that you haven't done before.
07110	We talk about effective military action.
07111	I sincerely hope not.
07112	Broomfield was the centre of the town.
07113	There is no such thing.
07114	However, their reaction could not have been more different.
07115	I was doing well at the hustings.
07116	The scheme is hopelessly failing.
07117	That gives it a spirit.
07118	It isn't just a defining issue for them.
07119	However, what is his calibre?
07120	If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere.
07121	Sub Not Used, McArthur.
07122	No other vehicle was involved in the incident.
07123	You need insurance to bring people in.
07124	What was it like playing real people?
07125	This ruling is unfair to everyone.
07126	It is, honestly, difficult to write about this.
07127	Obviously, Airbus is one of these.
07128	The singer's condition was not specified.
07129	It's too big a risk to take.
07130	It's an expensive part of their equipment.
07131	Our lives have been turned upside down.
07132	The General Election is all to play for.
07133	I saw the other car coming, but could do nothing.
07134	United were in control without always being dominant.
07135	Those who are unwilling or unable to improve.
07136	Which brings us to the question of money.
07137	It was my shortest audition.
07138	It's unsafe for society.
07139	But that's not the idea behind this article.
07140	Come to that, is any of this really happening?
07141	What did they think of her voice?
07142	Worse still, he might be singing Lady in Red.
07143	He needed a kidney - it's as simple as that.
07144	It was better than a soap opera.
07145	It's not a great art.
07146	It is easy to agree with him.
07147	We believe that the reason is poverty.
07148	It's my nature.
07149	He was shocked by what he saw.
07150	We had a really good experience with David.
07151	Next league matches, Dundee United Rangers.
07152	Golf is a game of honour and ethics.
07153	It is the wealthiest in Europe.
07154	I will go out with him any time.
07155	That's my big challenge.
07156	They said we were out of touch.
07157	Fatherhood is important to Tony Blair.
07158	The man was pronounced dead on arrival.
07159	The captaincy will help that, too.
07160	We meet again in Berlin.
07161	It's always the same, isn't it?
07162	Don't get me wrong.
07163	He died from multiple injuries.
07164	They would never let him go.
07165	I'm going to buy a car.
07166	Which is worse?
07167	I'm not talking about his career.
07168	Scottish Athletics is opposed to permitting a move.
07169	But what lies ahead?
07170	The whole thing has been a fantastic experience.
07171	We are committed to urgent action.
07172	I wish him well.
07173	Others may be trying to catch up.
07174	I read it every year.
07175	I think we've got the balance right.
07176	There is no guarantee.
07177	Some may end up in hospital.
07178	I let go the telephone and ran.
07179	News of the funding was broadly welcomed yesterday.
07180	Public safety is paramount.
07181	We've never seen so many.
07182	After that, the Scottish Parliament will run the show.
07183	I'm sure you all can relate to that.
07184	Scots actors should be so lucky.
07185	I was just doing my job.
07186	I think it will make a huge difference.
07187	The home team also had their moments.
07188	From day one, we were a family.
07189	Fishermen are still in a state of confusion.
07190	It's a metaphor for consumption.
07191	He's an excellent defender, strong and quick.
07192	That's hard for a woman.
07193	THE atmosphere was electric.
07194	The boys are very confident.
07195	This club have been fair to me.
07196	Secondly, there are other options for patients.
07197	I'm looking at ways to do that now.
07198	The first is in Whitehall, the second in Brussels.
07199	And we know that, because we know the hairdresser.
07200	There has been no reaction from them.
07201	It was more like a Labour Party rally.
07202	The group will report back in the summer.
07203	I will let you in on a secret.
07204	Don't you think it was a fine performance?
07205	They were the best team, but unlucky in the end.
07206	I enjoyed my work in the Scottish Office.
07207	Some were close to tears.
07208	I have great confidence in Annabelle.
07209	He's a sort of mystery figure.
07210	Europe is not a threat to Britain.
07211	He just wants to leave a legacy.
07212	Every game against New Zealand is.
07213	But they didn't much like that.
07214	We just wish they had done so before.
07215	I am sorry to hear this news.
07216	However we're capable of beating them.
07217	They chose the latter.
07218	I've not said anything to them, they know.
07219	That is how it will be judged.
07220	It's there for people to look at.
07221	Mr Straw was home secretary at the time.
07222	The farmers had no choice in the matter.
07223	They were assured that it would.
07224	I'm the one who has to suffer.
07225	She was charged with perjury.
07226	With us, we just want them to respond.
07227	But something has been lost in the translation.
07228	That's the last thing they need.
07229	I made a big mistake.
07230	England against France is always a big game.
07231	Government must recognise the problems of Aberdeen.
07232	The criteria have changed.
07233	Who reminded him about the score?
07234	I will not walk away from this job.
07235	Mind you, he hasn't been back for ages.
07236	How do you find the youngsters?
07237	They are declining elsewhere in the UK.
07238	It does not move, which is amazing.
07239	We've always had a very positive attitude.
07240	Part of England, is not?
07241	Mr Forrester reacted angrily.
07242	This is wrong, but that's believed.
07243	They were not up to the required standard.
07244	Finally, they have a journey back to their youth.
07245	Its people are inventive, talented and diligent.
07246	I couldn't put my finger on it.
07247	Taxation should be simplified.
07248	That's a trend which will be encouraged.
07249	But today was the real big one.
07250	Someone else can do the cooking that night.
07251	Actually, it turned out to be the concerto.
07252	He planned to relocate to Scotland, probably Edinburgh.
07253	After that, we made some changes.
07254	It has not yet opened to pupils.
07255	Almost overnight, he found his voice.
07256	I want my audience to be challenged.
07257	That, too, was over two years ago.
07258	Who do you think you are?
07259	Glasgow is a tour de force.
07260	I can understand why they have gone.
07261	They will give it a couple of years.
07262	Bob Dylan's getting old.
07263	Our number one goal is prevention.
07264	Mr Mason is claiming unfair dismissal.
07265	But there was no time for that.
07266	He confirmed that there had been no warning.
07267	I am not against a further inquiry.
07268	There are different cultures in different departments.
07269	He was caught and fired.
07270	I'll never have problems with any football managers.
07271	You will never replace the child.
07272	I'm delighted at Murray's appointment.
07273	The way ahead is not easy.
07274	He intends to appeal the sentences.
07275	There is no smoking gun.
07276	His primary residence is Scotland.
07277	It's an interesting title, Believing in Britain.
07278	You are going to take away my life.
07279	That was one very hard game.
07280	This is the start of a slippery slope.
07281	Don't hold your breath.
07282	O, Is there anything in the wound?
07283	It was blown out of proportion.
07284	We certainly hope we have been successful.
07285	Surely it can do better than that?
07286	Substantial pockets of resistance remain.
07287	Last night, she refused to comment on the accident.
07288	It is only one night, after all.
07289	Gilbert was not amused.
07290	With him are the symbols of his faith.
07291	He said he had no reports of casualties.
07292	It's easy to see why.
07293	The board is currently resolving its differences.
07294	There is no sign of anyone being hurt.
07295	He had lost his confidence again.
07296	So, where do we go from here?
07297	This kind of traffic is commonplace.
07298	It has proved a double whammy.
07299	We make good weapons.
07300	The vacancies are in support services and arts.
07301	It's like English in its underwear.
07302	I've been thinking about it for a year.
07303	This is the same old story.
07304	Above all the aggression must be stopped.
07305	All of us in Scotland should be vigilant.
07306	Everyone has his share of trouble.
07307	He loved his job and working in newspapers.
07308	I don't want a burial service.
07309	And it's time for new leadership.
07310	One might think that is a power.
07311	We've been calling for a level playing field.
07312	Smaller parties have reason to be pleased.
07313	I hope the voters will respond.
07314	And who would argue with that?
07315	I believe that gap is nearly there.
07316	There is certainly no single outstanding candidate.
07317	I ran to get out of the way.
07318	It was to be published next month.
07319	It's not a party, no, no.
07320	We have understood the problems for some time.
07321	But every country has its own character.
07322	I don't have a problem with getting older.
07323	In addition, it was just a breach of natural justice.
07324	I played really well on the back nine.
07325	I wanted the illusion of space and depth.
07326	My heart is not so sure.
07327	You have friends in the Liberal Democrats.
07328	It is a thing of beauty to watch.
07329	However, many of their victories have been close affairs.
07330	It's a delightful idea, but a distancing one.
07331	This is his personal life.
07332	Now he is trying to downgrade the media.
07333	Hollywood comedy is having a good week.
07334	Yet the consensus is, it's worth it.
07335	It's the tip of the iceberg.
07336	It is bad news for the flooded areas.
07337	This was the classical period of Beethoven.
07338	That is just a load of baloney.
07339	Any error of judgment was ruled out.
07340	The feeling is marvellous.
07341	I think they should have more respect.
07342	The crackdown is launched today by the government.
07343	Nor does it have a stock of medicines.
07344	It was a crucial moment.
07345	We gave everything we had.
07346	For one thing, he was growing far too quickly.
07347	His charisma is all on the course.
07348	This is purely financial.
07349	I will not be in dialogue with her.
07350	Our dispute is with the company, not with the travelling public.
07351	I did not want any damage to us.
07352	I didn't know the company all that well, or the dancers.
07353	However, you have just got to adjust to it.
07354	I saw them not long after it happened.
07355	This guy is never going to give up.
07356	Who said impatience is a virtue?
07357	You've got to have everything inside with you.
07358	But it obviously doesn't, so the government needs to intervene.
07359	The supporters gave us a lot of passion.
07360	Don't say you have not been warned.
07361	That is a mark of what you are.
07362	Seven children had lost both parents.
07363	It is par for the course, isn't it?
07364	Who, then, is going to be captain of Europe?
07365	Most people know that.
07366	Some people still think she should be English.
07367	Repayment is not part of the game.
07368	The cause of the crash was unclear.
07369	What do they pay to join the club?
07370	Two people are allowed to share the duty.
07371	We are now in a safe place.
07372	She goes to the opening of an envelope.
07373	It will be very useful for us.
07374	We just try to make great records.
07375	She had travelled to Spain to give evidence.
07376	I was unconscious for two or three seconds.
07377	It is, in other words, Entrapment by another name.
07378	His parenthood is called into question.
07379	Audacious decisions were taken early on.
07380	We really need research to help with that.
07381	At the time of watching, however, it is totally convincing.
07382	It was his twenty-first birthday on Monday.
07383	There were unconfirmed reports that it was cannabis.
07384	These things are important for clubs like ourselves.
07385	He didn't have time for any other hobbies.
07386	The League of Nations was also his idea.
07387	I've done it almost like a variety show.
07388	Their vision was not impeded.
07389	Sooner rather than later, though, the healing must begin.
07390	Next league matches, Dundee United - Kilmarnock.
07391	He went to see what he could learn.
07392	It's such a beautiful place, like a palace in Italy.
07393	The luxury has been well used.
07394	Today, however, half of them get this financial help.
07395	Only the scale of change differed.
07396	Tell you the team he picked?
07397	Winning, meanwhile, is headed back to New York City.
07398	The cold war is over.
07399	And it's more subversive.
07400	We are losing this war.
07401	Council officials are involved, along with the transport industry.
07402	After about a year, the feeling returned to my finger.
07403	They will know they deserve to be there.
07404	John Reid, the Scottish secretary, also welcomed the news.
07405	I asked why he had come.
07406	Will they ever reopen?
07407	After that date, the numbers should stabilise or fall.
07408	A lot of people were in tears.
07409	We have great team spirit.
07410	Otherwise it could have secured a cinema release.
07411	It could have been a hammering by now.
07412	Subs not used, Fernandez.
07413	It's a bit like a bereavement.
07414	It was tough, but we did have a lot of possession.
07415	Over the last four years, we have been fairly consistent.
07416	That end is enjoying life, as far as David is concerned.
07417	But, clearly, it is crucial to understand that point.
07418	What was going through her mind that day, that night?
07419	All kinds of things occur.
07420	It is always the same, isn't it?
07421	Who would take it now, after all this?
07422	That gives us something to kick against.
07423	Except, this time, it seems, he really, really means it.
07424	There is precious little middle ground.
07425	She was shouting my baby, my baby.
07426	The inquiry had been going on for months.
07427	They were both delightful to work with.
07428	It's my delight on a shiny night.
07429	I'd go anywhere to work, so long as it's worth it.
07430	Arsenal have plenty in the tank.
07431	It is quite an eye opener.
07432	Hillary plans to meet him on the summit.
07433	What, they maybe have three Scottish players?
07434	Can they be serious?
07435	For athletes in our current climate, their sport is their livelihood.
07436	That, in our view, is an important decision.
07437	It's just that we see different things.
07438	We are all family men with children.
07439	I think we showed that after half time.
07440	A wide range of restrictions are in place.
07441	There was pressure from elsewhere too.
07442	You let a lot of people down.
07443	One person was believed to have been hit.
07444	Mistakes are being made on an increasing basis.
07445	We aren't going to play better.
07446	They just would not have run away.
07447	Two men have been charged with his murder.
07448	Lifeboat is at the Tron Theatre, Glasgow, tonight.
07449	The guys have really enjoyed it.
07450	Charles Clarke is an idiot.
07451	Our people should be immune.
07452	Glasgow then took control.
07453	It is simple and easy to use.
07454	English rugby is on the brink of extinction, though, it's official.
07455	I think we finished fifth.
07456	It was not a foul.
07457	We know them as mobile telephones.
07458	Meanwhile, the action is spreading to Eastern Europe.
07459	I don't know exactly what happened.
07460	They were very, very anxious and nervous about their personal safety.
07461	The Government faces a moral dilemma.
07462	The pressure is on President Bush to deliver.
07463	But, because of the wood, no-one had the experience.
07464	It was a very difficult decision for us.
07465	I am not a happy man.
07466	I'm going with all three.
07467	Most of them were one-year conscripts.
07468	The line-up is a tasty one.
07469	I don't honestly know how to describe it.
07470	He wins the match with a passionate, committed, almost demented, display.
07471	Many, many people don't know who he is.
07472	Suspension will come into force at midnight.
07473	They should also have the right to vote.
07474	All the teachers are Afghan refugees.
07475	WHAT's in a name is this, the age of the Internet?
07476	They had given up on him.
07477	We didn't know if people would turn up.
07478	You know, he was struggling with his game all week.
07479	We have our supporters and our enemies.
07480	It did my image a lot of good!
07481	This Government believes in parental discipline.
07482	But there has never been the time, she said.
07483	This could be one such case, he declared.
07484	I fell in love with ballet.
07485	Mr King, who was present at yesterday's hearing, refused to comment.
07486	I spoke with just one player, but not the others.
07487	We're still talking with a few people.
07488	Nothing is lost, everything is recycled.
07489	Thames Valley police decided not to prosecute.
07490	Alcohol, of course, is strictly forbidden in Iran.
07491	All were later allowed home.
07492	She has a wonderful mind.
07493	There are just two tournaments remaining.
07494	We're into that build-up now.
07495	It is the end of an era.
07496	We can just get on with our game.
07497	But first it goes out on TV.
07498	We're trying to lessen the stigma.
07499	Sub Not Used, McKenzie.
07500	Both will be heard at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
07501	I learned a lot from her.
07502	Partly, but only partly, this is their own fault.
07503	They seem to be backing off from that.
07504	They have a very good method of working.
07505	Do you think you have a shot?
07506	I believe we have a good chance.
07507	She may even appear in some more films.
07508	Our idea is to make it entirely Irish.
07509	I've seen some of the submissions.
07510	I feel very strongly about that.
07511	It is a difficult thing to explain.
07512	His treatment has been quite atrocious.
07513	It wasn't a conscious decision not to shout.
07514	It is now very clear that doesn't work.
07515	My dad was working in Ayrshire.
07516	There are lots of these women in Finland.
07517	Drugs and housebreaking are linked.
07518	And who were they anyway, beforehand?
07519	She had been sexually assaulted.
07520	Meanwhile, Rangers will continue to search for a striker.
07521	Alcohol and nicotine are now no-go areas.
07522	They are so easy for youngsters to open.
07523	We have been treated with complete contempt.
07524	It was rather a distorted image of Islam.
07525	Mr Blair was in Washington a week later.
07526	If Glasgow is so interested, they have the right to bid.
07527	The pollution and the driving are beyond belief.
07528	I have been coming here for nine years.
07529	I felt under no pressure today.
07530	The Devil is the creator of weapons.
07531	And that was the adults.
07532	Last night, however, other experts were cautious about the claim.
07533	That is a job for the Government.
07534	And he had much need.
07535	Last night the bombardment was terrible.
07536	This can only help us go forward.
07537	But, even so, you always want to try something new.
07538	Andrew McLellan is no exception.
07539	Some have other commitments.
07540	He moved back to Edinburgh, where he lived with his mother.
07541	No-one, not even the Scottish Arts Council, was interested in her.
07542	The crowd was awesome.
07543	That was moving the goalposts.
07544	Rapid revision was required.
07545	What if the confession is, after all, a fake?
07546	We couldn't go very fast.
07547	Tony Blair, can you see her face?
07548	We have grown up in Britain.
07549	They had previously been on five-day notice.
07550	I am proud of those guys.
07551	It's been very exciting, very challenging, and a privilege.
07552	She is, however, fully conscious and able to speak.
07553	I'll go out and be aggressive.
07554	I wanted, really, to deal with two opposite energies.
07555	What is the truth about the cow?
07556	They will want to watch a winning team.
07557	Who is going to be penalised?
07558	I feel sorry for the Reds.
07559	Just see where the blood is coming from.
07560	In her opinion, the rich are different.
07561	Hopefully, the whole of Scottish rugby was paying attention.
07562	Last year, it was ligaments in his knee.
07563	Thankfully, we have started to listen to our customers.
07564	Sentence was deferred for background reports.
07565	I'm very sad and deeply shocked.
07566	Some of his family still live there.
07567	I get to work with very good people.
07568	Obviously, someone is not doing their job properly.
07569	I can't blame the fans for getting frustrated.
07570	I can appear to be nice and lovely.
07571	I don't think the Saudis will lay down.
07572	People tended to stay there for some time.
07573	An internal inquiry was launched into the procedures.
07574	My preference is for the single vaccines.
07575	He saw it all as a big game.
07576	Staff should be paid for what they produce.
07577	I would urge the Government to think again.
07578	I was happiest with my short game.
07579	We've got no plans with regard to recording, but who knows?
07580	I'm delighted with how he has come through.
07581	As if he were a High Court judge.
07582	Would he be able to live with that?
07583	It was also put on the Internet.
07584	Now that was a boxing movie.
07585	Top-up fees are not on the agenda.
07586	Today's ruling confirms that fact.
07587	I have learned a lot from him.
07588	He has been campaigning for change for years.
07589	I have beaten her a few times.
07590	They have their own audience in Edinburgh.
07591	So too Eriksson, as yet unbeaten on his travels with England.
07592	We are being hijacked.
07593	Mike Tyson went to prison.
07594	She admitted the theft of letters and deception.
07595	This is the first stage of catching up.
07596	This is a long-term discussion paper.
07597	In all cases computer equipment was seized.
07598	But we'll just keep trying to get results.
07599	There will always be someone, somewhere, willing to undercut on price.
07600	However, in October another partnership was announced.
07601	The pressure was now back on Mr Arafat.
07602	Mr Burrell was arrested almost a year ago.
07603	The South African defended his work ethic.
07604	The Olympic committee should be ashamed of themselves.
07605	You are going to Glasgow Airport, and not coming back.
07606	The new work will begin in the autumn.
07607	The written judgment was issued in printed form.
07608	He showed he has some things to learn.
07609	I just went for it over the weekend.
07610	I managed to take her completely by surprise.
07611	My first season in Scotland was fantastic.
07612	This is a totally different order of agreement.
07613	Nine of the tourists were killed instantly.
07614	He was arrested, but later released without charge.
07615	Ministers received the report with frosty reticence.
07616	If you have to pay for treatment, you pay for treatment.
07617	If you look at the beginning of Alien.
07618	Today is not about contracts.
07619	That says something for his strength of character.
07620	You see, it wasn't a tournament of equals.
07621	It's to do with play.
07622	Usually, you should leave it alone in the box.
07623	I've just got to do this.
07624	Rangers will have a massive support in Glasgow.
07625	That was the problem.
07626	Ministers are not involved in these discussions.
07627	Everything else is second.
07628	I think it is a sensible change.
07629	Sex is fun?
07630	He added, It's not a racial problem.
07631	We hope this scheme will change that.
07632	It was created by genocide.
07633	How could anyone take issue with that?
07634	He takes time out for everyone.
07635	Now, just two games into the season, he has gone.
07636	A number of people could not speak English.
07637	They have got off with murder.
07638	They had had time for little else.
07639	We have reports of this throughout Scotland.
07640	It probably didn't feel anything, she added.
07641	The settlement could run to millions.
07642	It does not stop at the border.
07643	We've always had three options, and none of them are perfect.
07644	How can they say that?
07645	John Reid, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday appealed for restraint.
07646	She added, It is a huge problem.
07647	You can't keep them separate.
07648	I still feel like a wee boy.
07649	He will be sentenced tomorrow by Lord Dawson.
07650	But there was a shift.
07651	Israel has done very little until now.
07652	A decision is expected today.
07653	We certainly will need to watch him.
07654	I don't think it could be clearer.
07655	Our offer will remain on the table.
07656	We are trying to establish a date.
07657	He is a man who lives to work.
07658	The website is now being amended.
07659	It was a bit of a struggle today.
07660	If you could have dinner with anyone, who would it be?
07661	It's amazing it happened in the daytime.
07662	He had a heart problem.
07663	That was the light relief.
07664	He has one son and one daughter.
07665	That, he claimed, was essential.
07666	I have great respect for all my players.
07667	I hadn't seen them in eight years.
07668	I am happy with my form.
07669	You can see their point.
07670	They married in August last year.
07671	However, in Scotland this figure was four weeks.
07672	Yet he chose to do something different.
07673	He was happy, the BBC was happy, the listeners were happy.
07674	I've just got to build on this now.
07675	Where is the anthrax?
07676	I love you so very much.
07677	Lord Johnston will give a decision later.
07678	A world away from Rangers, you might say.
07679	Sean Connery did not disappoint.
07680	Such a city does not exist.
07681	We would welcome a greater emphasis on carcasses.
07682	This has a number of benefits.
07683	That is in the very nature of farming.
07684	These matters are now behind us.
07685	To which the only answer is, don't hold your breath.
07686	Thousands of homes were left without power supplies.
07687	I love the tradition of vaudeville.
07688	It was then into overtime.
07689	Most of the public are behind me.
07690	I am still very much a director.
07691	I might have been sitting at home, with her out here.
07692	In some cases, the nation should be grateful.
07693	Meanwhile, the problems of Ball continue to multiply.
07694	Of course he is.
07695	That's how it worked in Bosnia.
07696	She is a very lucky lady.
07697	Was it a foul?
07698	Jamming would be equally difficult.
07699	We've been there for seven years.
07700	He was as good as his word.
07701	Promises were not kept.
07702	His signature is his handwriting.
07703	He admitted there were two aspects of fear.
07704	The sense of excitement in Stirling is tangible.
07705	It's not in my nature.
07706	You see - this business is a good one.
07707	Who is he?
07708	Serb forces then opened fire in their direction.
07709	Our members are concerned about their futures.
07710	It worked, up to a point.
07711	I can't stand this sort of stuff.
07712	It's fun and challenging, but it is not easy.
07713	NOW it is official, Barry Ferguson is staying with Rangers.
07714	We've got a great defensive club.
07715	I feel privileged to be here.
07716	I'm not afraid of that.
07717	If they don't, they might well decide not to play.
07718	She told me to apply for the crest.
07719	He explained to his audience.
07720	I think the Government should pay for that.
07721	I never made any offer to Mark.
07722	The actors are confident and polished.
07723	On that they agree.
07724	It is all one-sided.
07725	Here are some possible solutions.
07726	IT was a thoroughly modern affair.
07727	They were both very brave.
07728	He made so many bad decisions.
07729	It is anything but erotic, but that is probably the point.
07730	I would have dropped out otherwise.
07731	She said No, he's not in Elgin today.
07732	Nato would ensure they could return home, he said.
07733	Mrs Anderson said this one was different.
07734	But the row refused to go away.
07735	Our biggest threat is the BBC.
07736	They have admitted they cannot meet that outlay.
07737	This must be really short of ideas.
07738	I think he has undergone a sea change.
07739	I believe you may be that person.
07740	It was a big day.
07741	What makes a house a home?
07742	I think however, he was having a fit!
07743	I will not be pressured.
07744	I had another good day.
07745	We should be trying to keep him in.
07746	I would say so.
07747	Even for a British Open, this is different.
07748	I was the only one arguing differently.
07749	Sub Not Used, McKay.
07750	From a marketing standpoint, you can understand their concern.
07751	Mind you, who wouldn't?
07752	That might happen in Pakistan, but in Britain?
07753	The Real IRA was blamed for the blast.
07754	It was a tactical change.
07755	With this line-up, they didn't need to be.
07756	We have a lot of sympathy for applicants.
07757	Before he left, the skipper said the crew were brilliant.
07758	We don't have the credible evidence.
07759	It's one up to the Scots.
07760	I'm just doing artwork.
07761	And we still have to pay his salary.
07762	So there's a double whammy.
07763	I didn't have a trio.
07764	Their three other children had died as infants.
07765	She is a great talent.
07766	I hope my successor will do the same.
07767	We do things in an appropriate way.
07768	I have been totally taken aback by this.
07769	Are you in this movie?
07770	The things writers and directors say!
07771	The fans will support us.
07772	Is this new report the answer?
07773	It was a long process, but we got there.
07774	We need to be looking to the future.
07775	The whole team was rubbish.
07776	But when he left, the decision was forced upon us.
07777	Some of the players have not progressed.
07778	You've got it coming Kabul.
07779	They must act now to tighten the rules.
07780	Quite simply, no-one else is willing to do so.
07781	But, mainly, it is up to ourselves.
07782	Are his works inside out?
07783	It's the curse of our time, irony.
07784	It was not a difficult decision, he said.
07785	I am not a free trader.
07786	There were so many characters among them.
07787	It is a very resilient and deadly bacterium.
07788	However, there are also many areas of agreement.
07789	Now there's an even bigger target.
07790	They were the better side on the day.
07791	What went wrong?
07792	There is nothing like a fresh start.
07793	They chose to side with terror.
07794	This must have been severe.
07795	We're all in a state of shock.
07796	I thought he was part of the camera.
07797	Farmers have been an endangered species.
07798	We are in a learning curve.
07799	Why should we have been asked to share?
07800	He was released in March this year.
07801	She was just that sort of person.
07802	Instead, she just went away.
07803	It was chaotic and frightening.
07804	It is a question of balance.
07805	Soon the whole country will be level.
07806	The Chosen One doesn't always excel.
07807	I'm not interested in coming up with answers.
07808	Lambert will be playing against Belgium.
07809	We could not have asked for any more.
07810	People might not actually want the job.
07811	It is the logical extension of audio description.
07812	His rival's are spoken with elan.
07813	The table was compiled by the Daily Telegraph.
07814	I have a bunch of veterans.
07815	He also was in debt to drug dealers.
07816	I can assure you, the new Augusta National is exactly that.
07817	This is entirely appropriate and overdue.
07818	We just need the Government to act.
07819	The urgency is real.
07820	The criminal justice system does not do that.
07821	He will never walk the streets again.
07822	JOHN Anderson, the former Scottish national coach, is still unearthing talent.
07823	They are just bewildered and very concerned.
07824	I can't stop people thinking.
07825	The workers said they were treated like animals.
07826	That's the last thing he will do.
07827	I have not been so angry for years.
07828	I am ready for that.
07829	Do you mean today?
07830	This is normal for him now.
07831	But my heart is in athletics.
07832	Nobody ever gets to see them.
07833	A review group will report on Tuesday.
07834	The place became a war zone.
07835	It was to get even better for Motherwell.
07836	Both parties can win, and Scotland can win as a result.
07837	The surprise is its product is so poor.
07838	I don't have a new house.
07839	Thus the story will continue to thrive.
07840	See it while you can.
07841	But then, that really is the point.
07842	I didn't do too badly myself.
07843	Their expressions only reflected those of the audience.
07844	We have been working together for some years.
07845	Chris Paterson is a class act.
07846	He has never even been to Ireland.
07847	And that's the question for the Chamber.
07848	Do what you have to do.
07849	I'm getting back up there now.
07850	We believe the squad will stay together.
07851	There is a lot of anger.
07852	It was meant to rival the dollar.
07853	Mary is, as it were, the cause of her mother's death.
07854	Maybe, who knows?
07855	And the funny thing is, they usually do.
07856	It was a sell-out.
07857	We welcome the proposals, but they must get on with it.
07858	If there is default.
07859	She can't say where she was, what she did.
07860	I'll take what comes along.
07861	Jack McConnell is the obvious choice.
07862	She will just have wanted her baby.
07863	Scotland is losing business.
07864	We are working on the two things.
07865	We only lost the third goal.
07866	Women reported more depression than men.
07867	We will have to see, but it makes you think.
07868	The euro is your money, it is our money.
07869	Nothing has been going for us, but what can you do?
07870	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war on heavy rain.
07871	This is not a floating Las Vegas.
07872	It is not an amnesty.
07873	The important thing was to be there, and to experience it.
07874	Of course, this is nice to hear.
07875	It was between myself, the management, and the team.
07876	I don't believe you own anything.
07877	Blood samples have been taken.
07878	Someone came down and said, Can you read a script?
07879	He said he now intends to fly today.
07880	This means that our programme is quite unusual.
07881	A further police inquiry is currently being held.
07882	Some people begin to turn away, to go home.
07883	You're not stopping people using sunbeds.
07884	They said construction work could begin within weeks.
07885	We will continue to operate within the sport.
07886	But all forms of the illness are treatable.
07887	It is also central to the unfolding drama.
07888	On the contrary, some of the music is very expensive.
07889	It's a grey area.
07890	Retirement, who knows?
07891	It comes on like a tidal wave.
07892	England and Wales are likely to pull out.
07893	Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally placed.
07894	He was taken ill in December last year.
07895	It's all too short term.
07896	This, he told the committee, was not forthcoming.
07897	Meanwhile, the weather was causing widespread disruption.
07898	He also does not get along with Christina.
07899	If convicted, they face the death penalty.
07900	How things have changed since then.
07901	Therefore, it isn't getting the respect it deserves.
07902	For me, the tour is wide open this year.
07903	In the past few years, they have started to fight back.
07904	The Prime Minister was very honest and sincere.
07905	What are you supposed to do, just walk away?
07906	She opens tonight in Glasgow, at the King's Theatre.
07907	Henman is taking nothing for granted.
07908	You'd think there was a match on today.
07909	His options are severely limited.
07910	This is truly field of miracles.
07911	They are not an item.
07912	Why did they let him go?
07913	Another suggestion was dismissed by Virgin.
07914	I have made good progress.
07915	We do need a new one.
07916	We defended well, but couldn't do much in attack.
07917	He then had a swipe at Hearts.
07918	He told us about it the next day.
07919	There are a huge number of arts.
07920	They are, therefore, not in favour of dispersal of sex offenders.
07921	Housing is in very short supply.
07922	After all, he is the King of Scotland.
07923	People just came on their own.
07924	We are so, so lucky, so many people have died.
07925	You either have him or you don't.
07926	There are some new buildings in there.
07927	I am prepared to step down.
07928	I'm not a diva.
07929	There is great relief at this point.
07930	Look at them after three days of rain.
07931	I didn't realise it had reached that stage.
07932	There is no point in pushing it.
07933	He was the deputy editor at the paper.
07934	Few other services in Scotland are affected, the spokesman said.
07935	Completion is expected by October the following year.
07936	However, it very nearly all went wrong.
07937	It is not a definite proposal as yet.
07938	I will speak to Michael about this.
07939	This is not understood by people outside.
07940	I went straight to the toilet.
07941	She says the royal family get on well.
07942	Does a firefighter have to be killed?
07943	I've always been desperate to play this part.
07944	We haven't actually considered it down here.
07945	There is still much work to be done.
07946	However, details have yet to be worked out.
07947	All our thoughts and prayers are with them.
07948	One of them, a woman, is in serious condition.
07949	We were with him the whole time.
07950	From then on, Scott has never looked back.
07951	That's because we work hard at it.
07952	Since then, my life has been turned upside down.
07953	Headteachers want their pupils to conform.
07954	They said to me, Why don't you get into acting, Tommy?
07955	I feel my life to be at risk.
07956	Again and again, at every level, he delivered the goods.
07957	That would be poetic, wouldn't it?
07958	We need some confidence to get a win.
07959	This is a foolish idea.
07960	You might even have seen him.
07961	Sussex Police refused to give any further details.
07962	She collapsed and died a day later.
07963	You should be there with six different characters.
07964	I took a minibus into town.
07965	I do my job.
07966	Running costs are not subsidised by public money.
07967	Where are his symphonies and major concertos?
07968	Who do these people think they are?
07969	You cannot eat in the dining room.
07970	It is very difficult to find a buyer.
07971	It shows that we are civilised society.
07972	You will never forget the clutching horror.
07973	This was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
07974	She is living proof of their expertise.
07975	This one was my best chance.
07976	All were paid by the taxpayer.
07977	The fate of large numbers remains unknown.
07978	The children, were not thought to be so seriously hurt.
07979	These elements are not in the book.
07980	You look at them and you understand.
07981	I would like Glasgow.
07982	We have only nine months to go.
07983	Both of them have looked good.
07984	I like footballers who play well.
07985	The talking is going on, but the Iraqi people will survive.
07986	Well that's very New Labour, isn't it?
07987	It's hard, but if we don't do it, nobody will.
07988	Donald was a man with many friends.
07989	It is turning that way all across Europe.
07990	We were on top and could've won.
07991	That night was a terrible muddle.
07992	The next time he saw her, she was a different person.
07993	He was too good for me - too consistent.
07994	It is like being a qualifier again.
07995	Jimmy returned to Aberdeen, but she remained with George.
07996	I told you, you were doing it all wrong.
07997	Roy Keane is certainly the best.
07998	There are a lot of unanswered questions.
07999	That was a stunning drive from Jon.
08000	She didn't tell us anything new.
08001	There is nothing like this back home.
08002	And that gives a kind of freedom.
08003	I found a fault and it worked at it.
08004	This is all part of opening the door.
08005	We have tried to keep his head up.
08006	For the other parties, it is back to business as usual.
08007	He will become the sovereign.
08008	Everyone could see it apart from Kevin Keegan.
08009	The success story shows no signs of stopping.
08010	It is difficult when you don't know anyone.
08011	It's just gotten too big.
08012	Was all this really just five months ago?
08013	They were two different types.
08014	It need not be like that.
08015	At that time, there was no infection within five miles.
08016	Around the building, the atmosphere is brittle and hung over.
08017	The performance, for this listener, didn't come off.
08018	I just saw them for a few minutes.
08019	A management agreement, however, was conceded.
08020	People would say, He thinks he can do that as well.
08021	The site has been fully recorded and surveyed.
08022	Two things will count for us in Brussels.
08023	Today's meeting was open and friendly.
08024	It is the stop-gap before extinction.
08025	He must have something up his sleeve.
08026	If it wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
08027	They failed in their duty to Mr Logan.
08028	That means no more taxation by stealth.
08029	History may repeat itself with Billy Elliot.
08030	His expulsion would not solve the problem.
08031	After day one back, he may be revising that opinion already.
08032	Once they go away they won't come back.
08033	THE best marriages are made in heaven.
08034	The main thing is that they enjoy it.
08035	It is worse because she suffers from angina.
08036	The board has rejected her proposals.
08037	She is a very lucky young lady.
08038	The threat to rural areas is real.
08039	Tourism continues to struggle.
08040	That, however, can only be achieved by constant investment.
08041	But, in the end, he did - and blew him away.
08042	THE US is a diverse and colourful nation.
08043	This is a great shame.
08044	That was merely their initial problem.
08045	I'm going to help out in the summer, as producer.
08046	We said, What do you mean?
08047	I need them to set my career.
08048	They don't know each other, but they have made this commitment.
08049	It puts the thought out, for other people to think about.
08050	The fund has three elements.
08051	This is still a young team, you know.
08052	Everyone knew where they were.
08053	As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminster Hall.
08054	People will make up their own minds.
08055	After that he became more romantic.
08056	There is bound to be a formal complaint.
08057	It had not been a terribly inspiring end, either.
08058	People can get them if they want.
08059	Their message was simple.
08060	They are currently managed by Ian Wilson.
08061	He is a law unto himself.
08062	There are no easy solutions to this problem.
08063	An aide was constructed to get a copy.
08064	Part of Johnny was found some days after.
08065	It is just completely erased.
08066	I enjoy playing with both of them.
08067	Too often it is not.
08068	I tend not to look back.
08069	Technically, it was a very good performance by Scotland.
08070	I don't know what he was capable of.
08071	Our place as artists is to ask questions.
08072	It may also be her last.
08073	Maybe it helps us.
08074	She should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
08075	However, within five minutes they were able to celebrate.
08076	He made no big mistakes.
08077	There has been no cover-up - just the opposite in fact.
08078	I believe he can do a better job.
08079	Instead they were openly attempting to be helpful.
08080	That decision was applauded by Williamson.
08081	But their bodies were found at lunchtime yesterday.
08082	Well, was it?
08083	We won't let you down.
08084	Does it work, is it safe, and is it right?
08085	He was visited by UK consular officials.
08086	So we shall remain vigilant, and keep the pressure on him.
08087	English is the language of pop music.
08088	The Israeli government is destroying the peace process.
08089	She has seen, or heard, it all.
08090	Which Scot is likely to emulate his achievements?
08091	This time, however, there is a new venue.
08092	Who has the second highest?
08093	You can leave him, knowing the job will be done.
08094	I didn't even have the first idea.
08095	No person was charged.
08096	I've only met him three times.
08097	She looked very, very poor.
08098	Nato has completed planning for air strikes.
08099	Butcher has only one idea in mind.
08100	This is not great, but it goes well.
08101	Both are national treasures.
08102	And here is the rub.
08103	They are also exploited by the markets.
08104	I am really looking forward to it.
08105	I think, at last, the company will find itself again.
08106	I will never get over his death.
08107	We were very happy with our results, which were excellent.
08108	The mix with Tiger is perfect.
08109	Well, it happened to me, so it's happening to him.
08110	Off-duty nurses were called in at Ayr.
08111	They should have some measure of protection.
08112	They did not threaten anyone.
08113	Who is going to pay their wages?
08114	There is no hiding place in it, no room for passengers.
08115	Even then he was in the media spotlight.
08116	But this is not just a Tibetan issue.
08117	That's the kind of thing that counts.
08118	Construction would then begin.
08119	A century on, little has changed.
08120	Form and structure are his music.
08121	I don't have any bitterness about it, it's just a fact.
08122	Is the Welsh assembly going to go?
08123	The award was a lifeline for me.
08124	Victory, she insisted yesterday, was far more important than the rewards.
08125	For all his successes, he is accustomed to waiting for fulfilment.
08126	But it was a great decision he joked.
08127	They changed the world of music.
08128	The law has got to be upheld.
08129	But we're not the same person.
08130	He had just returned to Thailand from Canada.
08131	I saw the explosion and panicked.
08132	The punishment was swift.
08133	However, there are signs of dissent among his colleagues.
08134	I kept my side of the bargain.
08135	It also makes for interesting viewing.
08136	He released a half-dozen solo albums.
08137	That respect is missing in the Netherlands.
08138	There's always a solution, somewhere you can meet in the middle.
08139	It doesn't make them evil.
08140	Parts of the system are already overstretched.
08141	Tourism in Scotland is facing a financial disaster.
08142	It's like, If he's all right, we will go with him.
08143	She added, It is the same story in both countries.
08144	Lara is very, very much a girl.
08145	I try not to expect anything.
08146	There will be plenty to keep them occupied.
08147	It was, however, the wrong side.
08148	She is now planning a visit.
08149	It also calls for licensing of collection centres.
08150	Here he is, in effect, appointing himself a judge.
08151	No, it wasn't supposed to do that, officials admitted.
08152	I keep my fingers crossed.
08153	The encounter was to change his life.
08154	It's the best of both worlds.
08155	They have a way of proclaiming themselves.
08156	That is why we want this decision reversed.
08157	Staff were invited to make their own proposals.
08158	We tried everything, but it just wasn't to be today.
08159	After this, the exercise was due to begin.
08160	And she doesn't feel like Annika is better.
08161	I want my country to be a republic, not an empire.
08162	CELTIC Connections is here again - and the great debate.
08163	I'm just feeling very tired - but it's great.
08164	That's just the way the game is evolving.
08165	Michael is putting on a brave face.
08166	Hopefully we can use this as a platform.
08167	The next thing will be cutting journey times.
08168	It's an excellent idea that makes sense.
08169	This is a mental challenge.
08170	He accused the Prime Minister of dithering.
08171	Without approval, the sport will find it difficult to develop.
08172	Ferguson did not hesitate.
08173	He came in an army uniform.
08174	However, within those figures, income from overseas visitors increased.
08175	Cars are great for going long distances.
08176	It was published yesterday on the internet.
08177	I knew he would play two weeks ago.
08178	The general secretary, represents a new era in Labour party politics.
08179	So other options had to be explored.
08180	He is firm but inclusive and very fair.
08181	We will learn lessons from what has happened.
08182	One film a year is, he says, his natural rhythm.
08183	His female companion was being treated for shock.
08184	I have no plans to change the oath.
08185	We did not even get a free kick.
08186	He was married with a young child.
08187	Anyone remaining after that will be targeted.
08188	They serve a multitude of purposes.
08189	I am sure all schools would accept that.
08190	I am very sorry to be here.
08191	Is your life a little too easy?
08192	I think my game is suited to grass.
08193	The little boy was playing football at lunchtime.
08194	Industry leaders reacted angrily.
08195	And that is our first victory in Edinburgh.
08196	The conversion didn't go over either.
08197	He took away my childhood.
08198	Since then, they have fallen by more than two thirds.
08199	The way they play, it is hard to score against them.
08200	One, the Acute Services Trust, will run the general hospital services.
08201	We all like to see forgiveness and redemption.
08202	We aim to put them out of business.
08203	Tony Blair should get out more.
08204	We didn't enjoy the first game, but today they were excellent.
08205	He was just awesome.
08206	We now have to concentrate on the league.
08207	We need to move forward together.
08208	She was making a living, but her career was going nowhere.
08209	Both were later released after a check-up.
08210	No-one, however, was complacent about the size of the task.
08211	How good is Lennox Lewis?
08212	I would ask the fans to be patient.
08213	The son has autism and other problems.
08214	I'm very puzzled by it.
08215	Volvo is grateful to its staff in Irvine.
08216	We are both very confused and extremely angry.
08217	All things are possible if you believe.
08218	This was not just incongruous.
08219	It is patently true.
08220	You hope he prevails.
08221	And a mightily impressive recording it is, too.
08222	The fellowship is much more than a commission, he said.
08223	What the Department of Transport will make clear.
08224	I haven't just gone in, done a three-hour rehearsal, and gone.
08225	He is wanted by German police for questioning.
08226	It is good for their eyesight.
08227	I was loving that little girl.
08228	But you can't have it both ways.
08229	We don't just play golf in Scotland.
08230	That's why the young musicians have joined.
08231	This is a United Kingdom.
08232	I am aware that somebody made a threat.
08233	However, who could have predicted this result?
08234	Shyness has rarely sold in boxing terms.
08235	As long as it is possible, we will keep going.
08236	The pressure on the aid agencies is immense.
08237	The problem arises because he does so much.
08238	The answer is mayhem.
08239	Our young people are leaving.
08240	What, then, is the real thing?
08241	I can't believe anyone would agree with it.
08242	But is it ethical to practice in humans?
08243	I always loved the lightning in the movies.
08244	I see social work as a vocation, a commitment.
08245	I'm just asking them to improve their disciplines.
08246	You can say he gets a sizeable amount.
08247	The early evidence suggests he did not.
08248	Ferguson had a most productive afternoon.
08249	I hope you miss the cut.
08250	Morale is very high, despite the growing risks.
08251	We are seeking funds from government departments.
08252	That, though, was again according to manager McCall.
08253	He scored one goal and was on fire.
08254	I hate to say it, but you can understand it.
08255	Harold is a rarity.
08256	Walk out the door and anything can happen.
08257	I want him to take on Gomez.
08258	Her condition last night was described as critical.
08259	They tend to be easily influenced by others.
08260	Well, what do you know?
08261	There are some serious ethical issues involved.
08262	Europe has lost its way under the socialists.
08263	We have no choice but to shut down.
08264	The prognosis is excellent.
08265	I would not want to be young again.
08266	There are schoolboys in uniform.
08267	These findings would be made public.
08268	All the lads are totally focused on that.
08269	He added later, Normally, it's not a dangerous river.
08270	This makes no sense!
08271	It had a gigantic effect.
08272	I, like many others, will consider where we go from here.
08273	The team this year is going places.
08274	More money for students would help - in an ideal world.
08275	It took more than two years.
08276	Sullivan was later charged with her murder, which she denied.
08277	He said because people had invited him.
08278	That's the key issue isn't it?
08279	Its workforce is to be made redundant.
08280	Hopefully, it will pay off for me.
08281	Correction, knowing him, he might.
08282	Why does she suddenly win everything now?
08283	These guys will not lie down.
08284	The Tories election campaign has certainly been colourful.
08285	That is nearly four people every day.
08286	There are nine people here now.
08287	Which perhaps is just as well.
08288	He would just say it was terrible.
08289	This is the New Edinburgh.
08290	I hope it has helped the prisoners.
08291	We kept going right to the final whistle.
08292	For sure, you won't know unless you ask him.
08293	The final stage is paranoia.
08294	I am not holding the club to ransom.
08295	Wagner was never like this.
08296	Pig farmers are completely despondent.
08297	But they cannot go on ignoring the truth.
08298	We would love for him to stay, but he's going home.
08299	That's the sort of game you want.
08300	We're not travel agents.
08301	Scotland has been caught in the crossfire.
08302	He was telling me to keep quiet.
08303	I am not happy with proposals for widows.
08304	It is believed she had serious head injuries.
08305	The pilot was making a visual approach.
08306	I'd say we should give it a week.
08307	Many other Scottish locations also feature.
08308	Little Voice is on general release.
08309	That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
08310	There is no substitute.
08311	That nation is South Africa.
08312	Wednesday's decision came as a surprise.
08313	It was an empowering journey.
08314	It's not unlike the millennium bug.
08315	They had been together for about three years.
08316	Children are using books in a terrible condition.
08317	Everything has been destroyed.
08318	The painting was started, but finishing it was quite another matter.
08319	He is married, with one daughter, and lives in Kent.
08320	We just want to get stuck in now.
08321	Do you come from Moscow?
08322	He or she will oversee the leadership contest.
08323	We are aware of the tribunal case.
08324	That is the first job of the director - leadership.
08325	But he was a full, working member of our staff.
08326	That it is a brand name.
08327	We're talking about creating an attractive neighbourhood.
08328	They will have to make changes.
08329	They scored a goal, but we have to keep playing.
08330	It sounds a bit of an own goal.
08331	We are ready for the long haul.
08332	I look for dancers who are also actors.
08333	EMI is a prime example.
08334	I'm very pleased with what we have achieved.
08335	Not that Agassi was a believer.
08336	Nowadays, it is workers united.
08337	He is young but not too young.
08338	I played well on Saturday and again today.
08339	It will also take evidence from consumers.
08340	They've been at it for five hours.
08341	There is no answer to it.
08342	There was no let-up for the minnows.
08343	Birthdays are wonderful and terrible things.
08344	His English counterpart agreed.
08345	It was frightening, intense, and primal theatre.
08346	He wasn't really doing anything, so he wanted out.
08347	Anyway, she is playing a lesbian.
08348	I am not putting myself down.
08349	He's a joy to follow.
08350	Bob Dylan is getting old.
08351	We were lucky to have survived.
08352	Maybe we expected too much from the fixture.
08353	At this level, you have all to perform well.
08354	I just want to change my life.
08355	He did not oppose the divorce.
08356	Connell was standing there, ordering her to get up.
08357	He knew it would cost him millions.
08358	Law abiding motorists have nothing to fear.
08359	Clearly, she says, she would never resort to such devices.
08360	That only came out during a radio interview.
08361	We are now setting about finding them.
08362	We must not go down that road.
08363	It won't happen overnight, but things will get better.
08364	I am not among its admirers.
08365	But he is revelling in the big stage.
08366	Stock markets will be watching closely.
08367	If they have City backing, what is the influence?
08368	Moving from Manchester to London was upheaval enough.
08369	There is no magical figure, but there are criteria.
08370	And the reason isn't too hard to fathom.
08371	Scottish life can be like this, too.
08372	He has changed my life for ever.
08373	It's being very carefully looked at.
08374	It was a job he loved.
08375	It may encourage more people to prospect.
08376	Filtering through this material a composite finally emerges.
08377	Where was their passion, the power, the feeling?
08378	It looks like paradise.
08379	At the moment, it is being treated as a tragic accident.
08380	They want to avoid a flashpoint.
08381	The wealth of talent in Australia is awesome.
08382	Even though the show is seriously exacting, physically demanding.
08383	I had no qualms about it.
08384	Muslim leaders in Italy have denied the charge.
08385	McMaster had already seen the first part.
08386	We have been working closely with Holyrood.
08387	It was early morning.
08388	Partition is not an option.
08389	What other retailer would do this?
08390	This is usually done by the space shuttle.
08391	Anyway, even if they didn't it wouldn't have mattered.
08392	I won't go back to Holland.
08393	There was no cohesion.
08394	He is very popular in the squad, in England, and abroad.
08395	Jackson may well be right.
08396	My thoughts are with their families.
08397	Still, the experience was amazing, she says.
08398	She can spoon these things into her three bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
08399	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the god to foretell war or heavy rain.
08400	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green yellow light when mixed form yellow.
08401	It does make a big difference.
08402	Each one has its own system.
08403	Alright, it was a defeat, but it felt like a victory.
08404	It is a very special city.
08405	It has been blown out of all proportion.
08406	He's not very big, either.
08407	I've taken to the hills.
08408	My game is in pretty good shape.
08409	How come it is so often unnoticed?
08410	All of us do.
08411	It could have been just a quick fix.
08412	We are looking for volunteers.
08413	Whatever the final decision, one thing is certain.
08414	They don't take you to mass graves.
08415	What's it got to do with art?
08416	Happily we found it in the library.
08417	I know a lot of people who don't.
08418	There was nobody on the roof.
08419	He served in the Gulf, the Falklands, and Northern Ireland.
08420	The days of empty promises are over.
08421	Henry was strong and talented.
08422	We must improve our relations with the government.
08423	Within six minutes, they were two goals down.
08424	Martin Johnson, the England captain, was back, and commanding.
08425	He said it was the worst possible result.
08426	Both these events occurred on Wednesday night.
08427	It is just part of modern day life.
08428	I hope we can put it behind us.
08429	I'm thinking, what would be easier?
08430	That alibi is now gone.
08431	We actually haven't managed to meet demand.
08432	He now lives in Edinburgh with his wife, Caroline.
08433	It is simple, really.
08434	I cannot believe she has been admonished.
08435	A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said.
08436	PR for Westminister is their holy grail.
08437	They won the trophy in the Hoops.
08438	Not everyone, however, was pleased with the proposed changes.
08439	She could easily have been killed.
08440	Yesterday, one, from Aberdeen, was postponed.
08441	We're just a family working hard, working seven days a week.
08442	It's a flourishing and beautiful city.
08443	The same goes for personnel.
08444	We don't say there wasn't a massacre.
08445	That was a hard game to play in, very tough.
08446	There was an element of jealousy.
08447	Craig is still suffering seizures.
08448	That certainly brought me back down to earth.
08449	Glasgow deserved their win, but we made them look good.
08450	Because of this, he feels the hearing had been unfair.
08451	Does it feel like the ideas and emotions?
08452	He is only now regaining his confidence.
08453	Early warnings could help, but it's a scary thought.
08454	It separates the men from the boys.
08455	But the attachment took a lot of growing.
08456	Two and a half million people have died.
08457	Or so it would appear.
08458	I hope they understand that.
08459	She will also get a pay rise.
08460	It is time for a more honest approach.
08461	I want to play at the highest level.
08462	Stalkers are capable of killing.
08463	Britain may now be forced to listen.
08464	The trial is set for February.
08465	Glasgow is making inroads in some areas.
08466	Do not go into government buildings.
08467	There is only one caveat.
08468	We are still getting signals.
08469	And perhaps it is as simple as that.
08470	THE arrow was aimed at the heart.
08471	The New Deal will constantly be improved.
08472	THE headless man has finally developed a face.
08473	I heard some of his remarks.
08474	It has been in place since last July.
08475	The European Court is our only option.
08476	Do you think they would be any better?
08477	Racism is alive and kicking in Scotland.
08478	How much of a cop out is that?
08479	It will be the final push.
08480	Lord Levy said he'd started his life with nothing.
08481	You were the kidnappers.
08482	It is a very interesting subject.
08483	The women were on their way home yesterday.
08484	Well, it's not before time, is it?
08485	Debbie Harry was cool.
08486	Insurance will be covered by the receiving galleries.
08487	A hospital spokeswoman described his condition as stable.
08488	It's my favourite place to hang out.
08489	Councillor Gordon has refused to stand down.
08490	Although it was expected, everyone is very, very angry.
08491	But even without either, Glasgow will be outstanding.
08492	There is no date on this document.
08493	And now he tells us.
08494	Now, though, he is back playing superbly for Blackburn.
08495	They did, too, but it didn't matter by then.
08496	It is time to come into the limelight.
08497	It should have a health warning - it is addictive.
08498	His name is Michael Owen.
08499	I foolishly had done nothing about it.
08500	Again, this was genuine loyalty being recognised.
08501	By social devices, the two groups are coming together.
08502	Smith has not let him down.
08503	No, it's actually in a block of flats.
08504	They have two children.
08505	I'm really proud of my young players.
08506	People buy everything with cash.
08507	There was great support all round the route.
08508	It's amazing it happened in daytime.
08509	Scottish fishermen comended the decision.
08510	Or so we have long assumed.
08511	It's not just for classical music.
08512	All the names are familiar to me.
08513	They had not been handcuffed.
08514	I've never been limited on drugs.
08515	They could take the result away from them, couldn't they.
08516	Have we not had the rainy season already?
08517	We have chosen for the patients.
08518	He now describes himself as Scottish Labour.
08519	Why should we even be asked to share?
08520	Which means it matters.
08521	There is a great potential on this river.
08522	I was surprised by his response.
08523	This is a one-year deal, but who knows?
08524	River City is a showcase for Scottish talent.
08525	Officials say the city must achieve this.
08526	It may mean more money, but we don't need the money.
08527	A judicial review is also being considered.
08528	It used to bother me sometimes, but it doesn't any more.
08529	They could go no further forward.
08530	I don't know why you say goodbye.
08531	Appointed general secretary last September.
08532	They make it look very easy.
08533	I had enough on.
08534	And we're not there yet.
08535	It is a form of physical exercise.
08536	plays in dark blue.
08537	But, by that time, of course, it is again.
08538	It is something that we will put right.
08539	Survival is our aim.
08540	This is her first senior Scottish selection.
08541	There is a tunnel after the tunnel.
08542	But there are problems, such as retraining new staff.
08543	I had a sense of deja vu.
08544	His silence on the issue is interesting.
08545	They follow him everywhere.
08546	I couldn't make out what was going on.
08547	So we said, no, we're not going to do that.
08548	I had a choice, and didn't have to do that.
08549	I'm back playing football, which is what it's all about.
08550	Mr Miller is married with three children.
08551	Thankfully, there were no reports of anything serious.
08552	We have great sympathy with Danny.
08553	He should be a great asset.
08554	It means they actually control the programme.
08555	And also, whatever he does, can he really win?
08556	We are not out of touch with politics.
08557	We could have got three medals.
08558	We are at a crossroads.
08559	It didn't take long.
08560	This meeting is the path to salvation.
08561	Of course we make mistakes, but we don't make too many.
08562	I started on a fire a couple of times.
08563	It's not one for the purists.
08564	She said he showed no remorse.
08565	I'm a soldier, a soldier, a soldier.
08566	We always thought it should be digital, and cheap.
08567	It's a matter of huge concern.
08568	Three years probation is just a joke.
08569	The outstanding issues are still there.
08570	Inclusion and Autism, Is It Working?
08571	I'm not sure how they got there, but they are.
08572	He always has been, since his early days with Scottish Opera.
08573	That got me out of jail.
08574	This is not, however, a General Election reshuffle.
08575	The dictator of Iraq is not disarming.
08576	Scottish Women appear at Eden Court, Inverness, tonight.
08577	However, the move was bitterly criticised last night.
08578	We have taken steps to rectify it.
08579	Do yourselves a favour.
08580	Others said they had been beaten by police.
08581	They came into collision with Sergio.
08582	We also hope to meet the Ulster Unionists.
08583	He is a success story by any standard.
08584	I shall be voting Yes to support him.
08585	Is something which we just don't do.
08586	I've got a young family.
08587	I'm trying to stay open on that.
08588	It all seemed so easy.
08589	I really don't understand what is happening.
08590	The frustration was showing.
08591	Shaking his head, Mr Cook said he simply couldn't understand it.
08592	My friends were very envious.
08593	The snipers are also out.
08594	We are determined to establish the facts.
08595	The list is too long for this piece.
08596	If you don't enforce it, you bring it into disrepute.
08597	Entries for the event are still being accepted.
08598	However, there was no hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
08599	To all intents and purposes, he ran the show.
08600	Tonight's matches European Championship.
08601	It's like the Russians.
08602	The Greeks used it to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
08603	We're all family men with children.
08604	WHAT's in a name in this, the age of the Internet?
08605	It is now very clear that that doesn't work.
08606	These take the shape of a long round arc, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
08607	So we will cut their numbers.
08608	Who cares about that?
08609	Glasgow is going to be open for business.
08610	I know my job.
08611	They agree to meet.
08612	But there was a heavy price to pay.
08613	The most important thing was to win today.
08614	We have a strong team at the moment.
08615	At half-time you have?
08616	The butcher is very good.
08617	It was an ambush.
08618	Scottish sport was not mentioned.
08619	I was doing a charity concert.
08620	You have to have a sense of humour.
08621	It is not about changing our image.
08622	We are waiting for advice on the film.
08623	I hadn't been looking after myself.
08624	His father said, My son was lucky.
08625	But they also came with a downside.
08626	She was only doing her job.
08627	Are you listening, All Saints?
08628	And then came the seventies.
08629	I guess it is down to focus.
08630	I'm very angry about it.
08631	His track record is not promising.
08632	For a moment it was all about her.
08633	Sadly, the game will never see his like again.
08634	Trading Places was too obvious.
08635	They don't know how to do it.
08636	No details were disclosed.
08637	If you can get away with it, you do it.
08638	First is open defiance.
08639	You probably have never seen them before.
08640	Clearly, audiences are unsettled.
08641	We have avoided that at least.
08642	I love a clever reader.
08643	That is completely against Islam.
08644	Clearly, there will have to be changes.
08645	Smuggling is an increasing problem for the Government.
08646	I will wait until later.
08647	Whenever we heard about this decision we protested.
08648	Could it be?
08649	It is bad news for us and England.
08650	They had failed to explode.
08651	We're all involved in deciding where it goes.
08652	I am happy to play for Aberdeen.
08653	Nor should there have been.
08654	He was determined to write a novel.
08655	So is there anything left to say?
08656	My back is feeling really good.
08657	It was one he was born to play.
08658	But we are losing that connection.
08659	But he's not afraid to take risks.
08660	We shouldn't have a rush to judgment.
08661	I live on the streets of Glasgow.
08662	Did you get the script?
08663	This is an exciting time in Scottish politics.
08664	He will suspend it on Thursday afternoon.
08665	Four people died instantly.
08666	Jim Wallace has been running the Government.
08667	Nine other passengers were treated at the scene.
08668	I can't believe it's all gone.
08669	We will meet again.
08670	We are about to have our own Parliament.
08671	Justice was not seen today.
08672	This is not about revenge.
08673	How can we ignore it?
08674	It's totally double standards.
08675	It's something he works hard at achieving.
08676	We are taking the back seat on this.
08677	But he admits he is deeply upset.
08678	We told them in August.
08679	We are going to have a parade.
08680	That could be at least five years away.
08681	That is my role.
08682	You would be a fool not to listen.
08683	No other offers apply.
08684	Have you noticed?
08685	This is a wonderful honour for me.
08686	The Lobby is not failing.
08687	It was a takeover.
08688	That statement has never been withdrawn.
08689	How many cases have there been?
08690	But we have to plan for the future.
08691	And yet his legacy is doubtful.
08692	This advice was accepted by ministers.
08693	That's a pretty good percentage.
08694	I feel very sad and extremely cut up.
08695	You have to think not.
08696	They were due to have begun today.
08697	Do not listen to them.
08698	So what makes it so special?
08699	It will be easier for us.
08700	I'm pleased for him.
08701	This is our Olympics.
08702	Things are looking pretty positive at the moment.
08703	My goal was very important to the team.
08704	This is not a Scottish problem.
08705	I have worked with him on projects.
08706	And there is no cause for it.
08707	Manchester United were still trying up to yesterday.
08708	He asked me how they were doing.
08709	They would have looked out for each other.
08710	I've got three other ideas for the day.
08711	Well it had to be something, that's for sure.
08712	I think that's a bit of an invasion.
08713	The result today is an impasse.
08714	Nelson does not disappoint.
08715	The real world is full of competing causes.
08716	They've got to decide to do that.
08717	These are terrible offences.
08718	This is it finally finished.
08719	An announcement is expected today on their future.
08720	Did you see that?
08721	There is a demand for another hospice.
08722	Then they were awarded a penalty.
08723	They will have five minutes to decide.
08724	I see that any day now.
08725	But who knows?
08726	He was tough and relentless.
08727	This guy is amazing.
08728	We should not worry about other players.
08729	Ownership was the game.
08730	I love the moment of being first.
08731	Some examples are presented in detail.
08732	You cannot understand it until you experience it.
08733	I sincerely hope that will not change.
08734	Just don't go looking to be shocked.
08735	It was total confusion.
08736	The position on the euro remains unchanged.
08737	That is why it is so lyrical.
08738	He was correct in everything he did.
08739	I see no reason for them to be.
08740	I never agreed with that.
08741	He was dead on arrival at the hospital.
08742	I don't think it is vital.
08743	But he insisted that victory was possible.
08744	That could run into millions.
08745	It might not survive the process.
08746	The truth is, it is somewhere in the middle.
08747	I'm really excited about the album.
08748	We were desperate to get the game on.
08749	But there is a possible place.
08750	You can't have it both ways.
08751	But they will need to play to score.
08752	He is a joy to watch.
08753	They also have good neighbours.
08754	We are now open.
08755	There is no pressure from anyone now.
08756	Now it has become a big picture.
08757	We want to learn lessons from that.
08758	I've enjoyed the whole experience.
08759	He was totally without that form of fear.
08760	ALL IS busy but not much is happening.
08761	They have the cash to do that.
08762	This is a defining moment in this parliament.
08763	He wouldn't have played in all three.
08764	And that includes the Barnett formula.
08765	It is a great shame.
08766	The council has been open and transparent.
08767	I'll never think of myself as a star.
08768	It was a policy they were against.
08769	I believe that Scotland has much to gain.
08770	He has changed the country itself.
08771	I can certainly see much better.
08772	We then went to see the headmaster.
08773	I needed a little man in the crowd.
08774	It would then be up to the judge.
08775	Are we going to stay up?
08776	It was a very difficult period.
08777	It used to be less than five minutes.
08778	It is my fault.
08779	We are not asking for the moon.
08780	That used to be another thing of mine.
08781	At the election we will oppose the euro.
08782	As a schoolteacher he was an excellent coach.
08783	Teachers have been given the offer.
08784	I played badly, but it happens.
08785	What are the barriers?
08786	She says she has grown up.
08787	He met his wife and married in England.
08788	But it could have been written for her.
08789	It makes no sense.
08790	What will they called?
08791	We come here in peace, for peace.
08792	After New Labour, we now have New Unionists.
08793	Hopefully, they will not go through with it.
08794	He is married, with two children.
08795	At Riverside, the rematch was totally different.
08796	As in battle, the worst thing is waiting for it.
08797	We understand the changes in the world.
08798	It is a potential factor.
08799	The working families tax credit is far better.
08800	It added to the reverence.
08801	It is too early to say.
08802	I don't understand it.
08803	The teenager had been missing for six months.
08804	And then we got off the plane.
08805	I think it is wide open.
08806	We are all ecstatic.
08807	I hope he has learned from it.
08808	That doesn't just happen, you have to build it.
08809	Who honestly expected anything else?
08810	The search has been called off.
08811	The matter will come up again.
08812	Surely this is not supposed to happen?
08813	They were unable to revive him.
08814	This has come as a shock to everyone.
08815	Yes, it was too short a night.
08816	It is not for me, though.
08817	It really was my favourite.
08818	That is why this action has been taken.
08819	They should be looking at his victims.
08820	There were many positives for this club.
08821	There wasn't anything in it.
08822	Thirty people have applied for his job!
08823	That is a lot of writing.
08824	It is no place for a poet.
08825	There is room for me.
08826	For next season, we have time to restructure.
08827	The truth, of course, is very different.
08828	He has something in common with the Wallabies.
08829	This is not a birthday party.
08830	Darren is very, very good.
08831	It's a drop in the bucket.
08832	I've had a hard time, to be honest.
08833	I'd never be satisfied with just the relay.
08834	There was no disruption to services.
08835	It was a discussion paper.
08836	He had no problem with alcohol.
08837	This was a very tragic accident.
08838	I'm just a piece in the jigsaw.
08839	Only the details have to be sorted out.
08840	They say they feel different.
08841	Well, what can you do?
08842	Motorists will welcome this.
08843	She failed to win any of them.
08844	I think we're going to make it.
08845	I didn't know where they were.
08846	Clubs can only do so much.
08847	Many other areas are coming up.
08848	But let's not go down that road.
08849	Changes need to be made.
08850	I don't care to recall it.
08851	That's the way things are heading.
08852	Hard it will be.
08853	He just attracted people.
08854	I doubt it would be genuine.
08855	You must be ready to play anyone.
08856	It would have been a very explosive issue.
08857	It is the worst of both worlds.
08858	We need to tighten up.
08859	Just get on with your job.
08860	We expect a full house on the night.
08861	He said it was his greatest work.
08862	Like everything in Scotland, it takes time.
08863	We are not too surprised.
08864	They are not a set of options.
08865	But it was money well spent.
08866	Parliament was evenly divided on the issue.
08867	I would think they are just behind them.
08868	We would all have liked to run.
08869	That, though, was then.
08870	Last year, however, it was decided to dissolve the abbey.
08871	He added, however, that all options are under review.
08872	Which brings us to the Scottish connection.
08873	It is a catalogue of obstruction.
08874	I'm happy to contribute to that.
08875	We have high hopes that this will work.
08876	People ask about the concept of a team.
08877	Who has he fought?
08878	He came close to signing for Rangers, too.
08879	It would show them a positive way forward.
08880	Players were held in equally low regard.
08881	He also admitted possessing a firearm.
08882	He stands on Centre Court alone.
08883	Both reports appeared in the British Medical Journal.
08884	They were urged to get themselves in order.
08885	Here is a tale of devotion to duty.
08886	But don't expect an easy ride.
08887	Some US embassy staff have left the country.
08888	Her mother said she fell off a swing.
08889	We see little sign of improvement.
08890	The study, carried out by the consumer magazine Which?
08891	Ten years on, that advice is beginning to pay dividends.
08892	For example they could be in school uniform.
08893	Three further cases were confirmed yesterday in Scotland.
08894	He did the right thing by ignoring me.
08895	That tells you something about them.
08896	The father was treated like a criminal, and why?
08897	This rule is archaic.
08898	I am a drug addict.
08899	I've had to take time off work today.
08900	However, consumers may take a different view.
08901	Nancy is not sure how she feels.
08902	How do you resurrect a dying town?
08903	It's been a terrible ordeal for Margaret.
08904	I'm so proud of my team.
08905	This has not, and has been neglected.
08906	If you're a national company, you must provide it all.
08907	But they must serve their sentence in Scotland.
08908	However, it is much bigger than that.
08909	This season has been great for me, it's been an experience.
08910	For now, though, my future is with Rangers.
08911	If so, how does it intend to achieve this result?
08912	His handling raises a wider issue.
08913	This is not a recipe for conflict.
08914	He had done his homework properly.
08915	Alan Milburn, the health secretary, refused to comment.
08916	My grandparents were terrified.
08917	Are they control freaks?
08918	They never looked like winning it either.
08919	It is understood they saw one body.
08920	It was a wilful act of violence.
08921	T, Is there anything in the wound?
08922	She is a double victim.
08923	Everything on our programme is brilliant and diverse.
08924	It's the way we go about it.
08925	Each day is a new beginning.
08926	We've come from a long way back.
08927	A lot of things can go wrong.
08928	She was eight months pregnant at the time.
08929	There has been no delay on government orders.
08930	Everyone needs a holiday, even the Salvation Army.
08931	How do you respond to losing your child?
08932	Who is the employer?
08933	This is the biggest thing in the world, isn't it?
08934	McMaster is keen to draw attention to others.
08935	On this form, they have a real chance of going up.
08936	Two charges of threatening crew members were dropped.
08937	You can never have enough money.
08938	Being a taxi driver right now is horrible.
08939	I COULD hardly keep up with Professor McKean.
08940	Our plans for Dunfermline have not changed.
08941	Another suggested the company should carry only pedestrians.
08942	They do the work, you know.
08943	Thus far we have received no complaints.
08944	Other people also tried.
08945	Slater was fortunate to be wearing a helmet.
08946	It would have very little impact on them.
08947	They were even being used by primary pupils.
08948	This event allows us to emphasise the positive.
08949	They just made me feel dizzy.
08950	He must have sat down, relieved it was over.
08951	He will do so today in Monte Carlo.
08952	Health care workers and labourers followed.
08953	Blair also faces pressure from within the cabinet.
08954	Yesterday's performance was exactly that.
08955	We have all been shocked by her death.
08956	We are asking the council to think again.
08957	He had worked there for only two days.
08958	Hopefully, now we're getting it.
08959	But someone forgot to tell the Chechens.
08960	For starters, many of the Scotland team didn't turn up.
08961	Scotland need to work on two key areas.
08962	We have already begun to do that here.
08963	They refused to fire on their own countrymen.
08964	In my opinion it was a mistake, and never on purpose.
08965	That is where the club has gone wrong.
08966	I got off to a great start.
08967	It is scheduled to go ahead next Saturday.
08968	Singing has gone out of fashion.
08969	We begin, as ever, with a reminder of the end.
08970	I got on very well with Allan.
08971	That has given me great confidence.
08972	This is a dream come true for me.
08973	He was lying face down in the water.
08974	He urged people to forgive.
08975	So he is open to ideas.
08976	Central to their cause was Barry Nicholson.
08977	Not that anyone has actually suffered, for her art.
08978	We are expected to do better than before.
08979	I am not even thinking about that.
08980	Angola was a really hard place.
08981	It wasn't a flashy performance, it was very workmanlike.
08982	The sleeper was six hours late.
08983	He needed seven hours of surgery.
08984	They were later released, and last night were staying with relatives.
08985	I am saddened to hear of the accident.
08986	Suddenly it was, indeed, a new ball game.
08987	The actors just have to say so.
08988	I think it was briefly considered.
08989	It's a hidden problem.
08990	I lost a part of me.
08991	Surely, if anything, it would be the other way round.
08992	It's part of the game, isn't it?
08993	I believe in the Church.
08994	Others were even less confident.
08995	It will only work with changes in lifestyle.
08996	So people will come out with these things.
08997	My only ambition is to enjoy my work.
08998	That doesn't mean the Cabinet has to endorse.
08999	He takes his time, and won't be rushed.
09000	It shows that painting is still relevant.
09001	Then there's one where people play for fun.
09002	It may be his last for a while, too.
09003	They have enough intrusion at the time.
09004	Then one night only three people turn up.
09005	Now we see the impact of global politics.
09006	Borrowing power was one of those improvements.
09007	There have been a lot of lessons learned.
09008	I think we will join the single currency.
09009	Everything was up for grabs.
09010	I think, overall, they were the best team in the tournament.
09011	There will not be any charges.
09012	So the process was refined.
09013	I know when my time is, it doesn't bother me.
09014	They were at her bedside when she died.
09015	In the meantime, he added, prevention was the key.
09016	The composer therefore believes he can do it.
09017	We can only go up.
09018	It's an internal matter.
09019	Whoever said that cannot have seen it.
09020	I am now just a bit uneasy.
09021	I'm quite embarrassed and ashamed of doing that.
09022	This is a very positive step forward.
09023	It's up to their parents to choose.
09024	It is still holding good today.
09025	His sister added, We expected him to be jailed.
09026	The airspace above the theatre was closed off.
09027	We cannot rely on protracted legal proceedings.
09028	We didn't know he was even out.
09029	That's what it's all about, isn't it?
09030	I am astonished by this decision.
09031	We will see how he is.
09032	Now we need to keep our heads up.
09033	They too refused to come out and talk.
09034	Eating was a nightmare, and it wasn't possible to sleep.
09035	Now there is an even bigger target.
09036	There has been a big change in defence.
09037	The Treasury confirmed that the latter was correct.
09038	The company has other problems with the shells.
09039	Injury has played a part, but not a big one.
09040	Meanwhile, the business of government goes on.
09041	It broke up my marriage.
09042	Two years ago, the commission did not want to get involved.
09043	The love affair was over.
09044	For some, it was more painful than others.
09045	She had every right to read the warrant.
09046	Several people were out in the street.
09047	It is not an abortion.
09048	Such people do not exist.
09049	We've still got a say in this.
09050	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its paths high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
09051	Since then physicists have found that is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
09052	This is not an amnesty.
09053	Mr Cook, a left-winger from Britain, would be ideally replaced.
09054	We welcome the decisions of Mr Byers.
09055	He also does not get on with Christina.
09056	It is truly fields of miracles.
09057	They told us about it the next day.
09058	You've seen the polls then, Sean.
09059	It shows that we are a civilised society.
09060	It's a commission, and for it's work, a year's work.
09061	It was extremely foolish behaviour on your part.
09062	The faith of large numbers remain unknown.
09063	These elements are in the book.
09064	It was turning that way all across Europe.
09065	If we live forever, can we be said to live?
09066	It was a stunning drive from Jon.
09067	I found a fault and worked at it.
09068	This is all part of being opening the door.
09069	It's the stop-gap before extinction.
09070	This is a young team, you know.
09071	As agreed, the prime minister was driven to Westminister Hall.
09072	We've always had three options, and none of them perfect.
09073	They're currently managed by Ian Wilson.
09074	An aide was instructed to get a copy.
09075	It was just completely erased.
09076	I tend to not look back.
09077	I didn't know what he was capable of.
09078	We should savour this, because it's unlikely ever to happen again.
09079	I'm aware that somebody made a threat.
09080	That, though, was again according to the manager McCall.
09081	Wanger was never like this.
09082	Filtering through this material a composite finale emerges.
09083	But who gets on the tube?
09084	Now you see him, now you don't.
09085	So now this series has had its day.
09086	Bobby Robson called him a genius.
09087	His wife Margaret was not in court.
09088	Slowly, however, a picture is emerging in Scotland.
09089	They take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
09090	The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition on a number of bows.
09091	But that attachment took a lot of growing.
09092	They said she had been visiting her son, who is unemployed.
09093	Do you think they would do any better?
09094	For now, we must take one game at a time.
09095	They've two children.
09096	Scottish fishermen condemned the decision.
09097	All of the names are familiar to me.
09098	There is great potential on this river.
09099	There is a club on the rise.
09100	And that's good news for the magpies.
09101	We've turned the corner.
09102	We've taken steps to rectify it.
09103	We're determined to establish the facts.
09104	However, there was hope, and glory too, for Scotland.
09105	So, the question is, is it any good?
09106	I couldn't see any reason not to die.
09107	They are there to get people into work.
09108	I'm getting long in the tooth.
09109	They would be wise to do just that.
09110	Strathclyde Police yesterday declined to comment on Ferris.
09111	Some old favourites remain in varying forms.
09112	I'd go to bookshops.
09113	It is time to fight a decisive battle.
09114	Its national defence policy is defensive in nature.
09115	Military chiefs were playing it straight.
09116	There was no hint of bravado.
09117	She's a valuable member of the Government.
09118	I just need a bit of luck.
09119	Again, it's about responding to your resources.
09120	Managers and clinicians must work together.
09121	The princess has had other health problems.
09122	There are two games to go after that.
09123	His replacement was named yesterday, following inquiries by The Herald.
09124	Investment in quality, service and marketing were the only way forward.
09125	She now suffers from multiple sclerosis.
09126	It was a UK-wide report.
09127	This is a dreadful day for Iona.
09128	He spoke about the choices facing them, and their country.
09129	The discussions will surely not last too long.
09130	We'll talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome.
09131	They have not let anyone into the loop.
09132	So just what is her enduring appeal?
09133	It's not easy to live in Russia.
09134	I am content with the silver.
09135	We have fun in our lives.
09136	This, too, could prove a risky business.
09137	You have to audition for jobs.
09138	We're not comparing like with like.
09139	We have always been, and remain confident of securing the order.
09140	She was released from hospital yesterday.
09141	That is not just my personal view.
09142	Liberal Democrat leader makes a hash of it.
09143	We've got to get it right.
09144	The trouble is, though, that there is no simple solution.
09145	Would you take them?
09146	I find it puzzling and disturbing.
09147	He lost his job, but it was not just a job.
09148	His condition was stable last night.
09149	At present it is fairly uncommon, but its incidence is increasing.
09150	It was nerve-racking to watch.
09151	It remains in public ownership.
09152	The Master was by then just too old.
09153	All credit to them, they took their chances, we didn't.
09154	It's a very high number.
09155	I leave tonight for England.
09156	This is a thoroughly handsome and enjoyable production.
09157	I have no argument with Scotland.
09158	There are simply no orders.
09159	Sutton is playing as well as ever today.
09160	Like anyone else, he has to take his time.
09161	I haven't spoken to anyone about that, not even my wife.
09162	Or so she thought.
09163	It was another good idea.
09164	The Foreign Office was conspicuous by its absence.
09165	When the sunlight strikes the raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow.
09166	These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and these two ends apparently beyond the horizon.
09167	Some have accepted it as a miracle without any physical explanation.
09168	The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from gods to foretell war or heavy rain.
09169	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which gods passed from earth to the home in the skies.
09170	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbow.
09171	He was the youngest of the British team.
09172	I fell in love with the ballet.
09173	That their music is truly, truly, truly great.
09174	It feels like a winner already.
09175	And the winners are.
09176	I can't believe something like this could happen.
09177	He didn't really, we just made that up.
09178	Scotland has lost a great religious leader.
09179	It is easy to be wise in hindsight.
09180	Buying our way out is not an option.
09181	There are big names.
09182	Normally, they have been a pack of lies.
09183	I hope you will leave it at that.
09184	Again, that was genuine loyalty being recognised.
09185	I fell to the ground.
09186	They were not defeated.
09187	All of us know it exists.
09188	Moray Council could not be contacted last night.
09189	This is the band.
09190	We shall not do that.
09191	This is about the Orange Order.
09192	In fact, they will not be disciplined.
09193	We're not the tourist board.
09194	Overall, though, it has been a pretty good week.
09195	That was then and this is now.
09196	Are you watching Liverpool?
09197	He would be with his peers.
09198	They don't work anymore anyway.
09199	I wish they, too, would get a grip.
09200	I am so sorry.
09201	However, it is no longer with the national team.
09202	He also called in at another farm.
09203	I agree with them.
09204	Now he will have to start again.
09205	I don't know how it happened.
09206	Peter doesn't want to leave.
09207	In fact, that would be a distortion of the truth.
09208	He wouldn't allow that to happen.
09209	But there is another side.
09210	It may be argued.
09211	His three-year appointment begins on Monday.
09212	Five in a month isn't good enough.
09213	This is just one example.
09214	Both offices were closed yesterday.
09215	They don't have to, but they normally do.
09216	We stopped at half-time.
09217	David was not either.
09218	We don't see it as downgrading.
09219	People can describe a moment in their life.
09220	The starting point is pretty unusual.
09221	Is that too much to ask?
09222	I've so much respect for him.
09223	This is a job for the Government.
09224	We started with that.
09225	It's never the same problem.
09226	Jonny Wilkinson had an off-day on Saturday.
09227	I was over the moon.
09228	And really, the songs are the key thing.
09229	Four minutes later, the show was over.
09230	Northern Ireland is a society divided by religion.
09231	Last week, he was taken to the hospital.
09232	He put a lot of effort into it.
09233	However, you have just got to adjust it.
09234	He was pronounced dead in hospital.
09235	The club are feeling no different today.
09236	I see the extended family once a year.
09237	I'm not a magician.
09238	There was even a joke.
09239	The show is small but perfectly formed.
09240	This is the first job of the director - leadership.
09241	I just had so much fun.
09242	They responded with victories.
09243	That was the personal impulse.
09244	I think it's awful.
09245	This will be just another tax on motorists.
09246	He is a Satan.
09247	We will not break even.
09248	However, it very nearly went wrong.
09249	Things are moving together.
09250	Look at the table.
09251	Last year was not a good year.
09252	It's a difficult job.
09253	It's more like a Labour Party rally.
09254	It will be even more difficult tomorrow.
09255	We went on to become very successful.
09256	No, is the answer to your first question.
09257	We certainly did enough to win it, but didn't.
09258	It really is taken seriously.
09259	It's such a trial!
09260	I think it is totally wrong.
09261	The reason is the thought of Olympic gold.
09262	Well, when did he ever refuse?
09263	Today's ruling confirms that.
09264	I'd never heard him in person before.
09265	We're going to change our party.
09266	Is he any good in the kitchen?
09267	That was the most annoying thing.
09268	We had no part in it.
09269	It wasn't so pathetic, it would be funny.
09270	That would have been too easy.
09271	This is not a faceless system.
09272	Boarding school was equally protective.
09273	Clearly, this was the important nursing.
09274	The campaign was raucous.
09275	But both were involved with other matters.
09276	But we were wrong.
09277	There is no threat to them.
09278	The goal will stay with me forever.
09279	It is a high time to act.
09280	There was barely a handful of chances.
09281	I have found my vision.
09282	We don't know the scale of need.
09283	You need a reason for staying.
09284	Quite simply, for once in his life, he got it wrong.
09285	I don't expect to see that this time.
09286	That is not the way we should operate.
09287	More likely, perhaps, it is that he will stay in England.
09288	Or do they?
09289	It is now time for justice.
09290	That is of no use.
09291	I could have been offended.
09292	Now it is measuring it in dollars.
09293	But he is frustrated at every turn.
09294	He was down the right, the left, and through the middle.
09295	This is the lowest of the low.
09296	Brian Wilson, in case you didn't know, is a genius.
09297	Clearly, it is time to meet this young man.
09298	It is a decision which has paid off.
09299	Their mind was already made up.
09300	But it's got to be worth it.
09301	But does the same thing happen with music?
09302	I just couldn't believe what had happened.
09303	Alex is a big part of that future.
09304	Pray that is so.
09305	In fact it isn't related to either.
09306	There was support from across the board.
09307	There may be some evidence to this effect.
09308	It is playing long, but it is also in beautiful condition.
09309	So what does one do?
09310	The methadone programme is completely out of control.
09311	That is why it's so lyrical.
09312	It has the Bank of Scotland behind it.
09313	And they all had these other commitments.
09314	However, there you have it, success has eluded them so far.
09315	They were unconfirmed reports that it was a cannabis.
09316	I didn't actually believe them at first.
09317	We knew their goalkeeper would take the chance.
09318	There was only one hole in it.
09319	I don't think it's vital.
09320	The issue has still to be resolved.
09321	We were close, but not close enough.
09322	And that started me thinking.
09323	It brings together two essential elements.
09324	The film is about the cost of genius.
09325	They've been here before.
09326	I think it's a disgrace.
09327	So he should be.
09328	When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.
09329	No sooner had we got it, than we wanted it different.
09330	It's ahead of Labour.
09331	It was a matter of chance.
09332	Strictly speaking, it shouldn't be like this.
09333	We keep a distance.
09334	She went home from school and never returned.
09335	With actors it is slightly different.
09336	They did a very good job.
09337	That's what we're still trying to do.
09338	He tried to stop it, but it was already too late.
09339	We cannot go on in this fashion.
09340	There can be no two ways about it.
09341	What would you do if you didn't work?
09342	They are already on the way there.
09343	We will miss him very much.
09344	They should go ahead as normal.
09345	At the moment, Michael is in a class of his own.
09346	It ended as it began, in confusion.
09347	I just went a bit too far.
09348	Sure, that already happens in New Zealand.
09349	He is a visionary.
09350	I was the trial judge in both.
09351	I have a choice.
09352	It happens in many countries.
09353	It's not just about the shows.
09354	Already the children are dying.
09355	We don't do this for everyone, of course.
09356	We've got a job to do.
09357	You just have to adjust.
09358	I've done nothing wrong, and that's the truth.
09359	They are there to help us.
09360	I have hardly any commitments.
09361	It is a very special place.
09362	Some things in life you have to accept.
09363	Everyone is working together to resolve the problems.
09364	Surely history will not repeat itself.
09365	The initial report has been completed.
09366	He's got me very well.
09367	It is quite a new prescription.
09368	Johnsen is equally concerned.
09369	Which he is, too.
09370	But things are never the same again.
09371	He, too, will return.
09372	Is there anything in the wound?
09373	It is not really used by many people.
09374	There could be no dispute about our history.
09375	Otherwise we will pay the price.
09376	I find it rather oppressive.
09377	They are all Arabs.
09378	It is already making a difference.
09379	He decides to do something about it.
09380	There were no new cases yesterday.
09381	Someone else has now got them.
09382	But once again it was not converted.
09383	This is a most serious matter.
09384	Everyone at the school is delighted for Steven.
09385	It was a bit of a shock.
09386	The hearing was continued until a later date.
09387	Planning is a key issue.
09388	Did he always want to be a comedian?
09389	I could do a better job.
09390	Yet what is supposed to be said?
09391	Parole isn't a decision for me.
09392	I get the bus.
09393	We are still the best team in Britain.
09394	They got the job done.
09395	It's a horrific incident.
09396	We've not won anything yet.
09397	They did not let him down.
09398	I believe in trade unions.
09399	This is in a league of its own.
09400	It's been such a waste of money.
09401	The money is not really our concern.
09402	You just know it.
09403	I certainly think it's very short-sighted.
09404	At Westminster, there was disbelief at the news.
09405	He was part of South Africa.
09406	They never got into the show this time.
09407	But no, it's not funny.
09408	He changed my life.
09409	There was nothing else to match it.
09410	Two options are being proposed.
09411	O, Is there a lot of blood?
09412	Willie deserved it, for what he has achieved.
09413	I've thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
09414	This is a very interesting move.
09415	The highest rate is in Glasgow.
09416	those who are preparing to give up.
09417	I was delighted with every one of them.
09418	That will help my case a bit.
09419	It feels that the game is off.
09420	There will be no change in government.
09421	Another man said, It was horrible.
09422	But we still don't know.
09423	I have no battle with the Scots.
09424	I have done ever since it was published.
09425	Nobody could survive on that.
09426	They seem to turn up for them.
09427	He confirmed there had been no warning.
09428	She was not hard done by.
09429	Can you believe it?
09430	However, planners should be taking the lead.
09431	I'm very frightened of the dark.
09432	This has been a shock.
09433	Everything in the symphony is there.
09434	There has also been some Scots input.
09435	This time, he will be more on the defensive.
09436	But who will buy it?
09437	It had to be more flexible.
09438	Openness is always the best way.
09439	It wouldn't go off.
09440	This was a lot of numbers.
09441	Would it be good for the Nationwide League?
09442	The whole thing has been a nightmare.
09443	But it's just great to have won.
09444	And it paid off.
09445	Gone with them is any sense of narrative.
09446	Those Were The Days, indeed.
09447	He admitted the asylum system was not working.
09448	They are just trying to cover up.
09449	We have to defend ourselves.
09450	Where do we go from here?
09451	Barry Ferguson is one of them.
09452	This was an option from the beginning.
09453	Clearly he is keeping in touch.
09454	It may not be life long.
09455	It was just above the roof.
09456	It has changed, and not for the better.
09457	However, that is a sizeable if.
09458	Everyone must be focused on the league.
09459	The English are coming.
09460	Only four of his passengers were uninjured.
09461	It's time to say enough is enough.
09462	He has to pull back from the brink.
09463	She has insisted she did nothing wrong.
09464	That's my daughter acting.
09465	The film has also been superbly designed.
09466	The performance was really, really immense.
09467	Faces from the Eighties.
09468	The family baton is handed on.
09469	How can this be?
09470	We are still alive and kicking.
09471	I want to go now.
09472	There are many questions to be answered.
09473	Our thoughts and prayers are with her family.
09474	All the children on the roll are genuine.
09475	There is no point in denying that.
09476	The kids are paying the price.
09477	He said he was delighted by the award.
09478	They didn't find any substance.
09479	They still have the dirty work to do.
09480	It doesn't seem like that long ago.
09481	He will do very well.
09482	They also intend to travel today.
09483	There's a lot of hysteria.
09484	There are two ways to start a festival.
09485	Awareness in Europe of Scotland is high.
09486	Even then this game was not over.
09487	Seaman is not a goalkeeper of old.
09488	It has become very confused.
09489	Fame and money followed.
09490	I am not in denial.
09491	So there is a very real dilemma.
09492	I can't believe we didn't win that game.
09493	Then there's the Old Firm.
09494	They're not always the same person.
09495	It would have to be backdated.
09496	My position on the euro is quite clear.
09497	We have worked well with them for years.
09498	That was me today.
09499	That is when we are really effective.
09500	The director's a genius.
09501	There was no sign that anything was amiss.
09502	This is new money.
09503	We have not given up on the game.
09504	Yes, it was uplifting.
09505	This is not out of choice.
09506	But don't just take my word, for it.
09507	But this one has a lot of potential.
09508	It's a big challenge for the audience.
09509	We'll see what happens.
09510	This was another video cassette.
09511	He pretended not to care.
09512	I was in tears in the street.
09513	If he could've prevented it happening, he would have.
09514	The German had a point to make.
09515	You have to feel for the guy.
09516	Bomber was not amused.
09517	They would have been forgiven for doing so.
09518	Was it just negligent.
09519	And suddenly it became a free-for-all.
09520	This Government is cutting taxes.
09521	Things don't look too good at the moment.
09522	I couldn't quite believe it, and still can't.
09523	They will now get that support.
09524	I feel it's time to make the switch.
09525	I've no problem with what they said.
09526	I think we have got the balance right.
09527	So it goes on.
09528	I hope they will understand the reasons.
09529	They should have listened to me.
09530	I am greatly encouraged.
09531	What does he want him to look like?
09532	I hope he would have been very pleased.
09533	It's unusual to say the least.
09534	I just did not cope with the pressure.
09535	We have some concerns.
09536	This was a chilling echo.
09537	They really want to do it.
09538	And then he laughs.
09539	We don't ask for much.
09540	I had a wonderful time working with him.
09541	We have to start again on Saturday.
09542	My players are precious to me.
09543	I had to calm down.
09544	They haven't run away.
09545	Nobody can take it away from me.
09546	He said no survivors had been found.
09547	Sadly, in this case, that was not so.
09548	She is a veteran in the Balkans.
09549	It was the same old story.
09550	I was frustrated here.
09551	This will be no easy option.
09552	They knew they shouldn't have been there.
09553	Of course we aren't.
09554	We haven't been told.
09555	We will listen to colleagues.
09556	It's very difficult and very worrying.
09557	It's something we want to make work.
09558	Many complicated ideas about the rainbows have been formed.
09559	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increase as the size of the drops increases.
09560	Perhaps that was their mistake.
09561	This was a rationing decision.
09562	The way forward is working with other disciplines.
09563	He is doing the right things.
09564	I've got the poster.
09565	This is excellent news for the workforce.
09566	Haven't been so lucky since.
09567	Well, you might have a point.
09568	It was quite distressing for the crew.
09569	Now the show is for public consumption.
09570	That decision is now being appealed.
09571	This is really good news for us.
09572	I wish it wasn't so, but it is.
09573	I shouldn't have put up with it.
09574	I think so - he seems to be in good health.
09575	I think it must be the uniforms.
09576	This is not a monument to the past.
09577	I certainly hope not.
09578	However, there could be more bad weather to come.
09579	Back then it was hard to refuse.
09580	I was in the zone in the morning.
09581	In fact, it might just be the beginning.
09582	The children are being very brave.
09583	My only concern is for my children.
09584	This is welcome news.
09585	The trust has no magic wand.
09586	The rest, of course, is history.
09587	Will you just put it away?
09588	I think it's more important to have fun.
09589	It is still with Ministers.
09590	It showed him the way to drive.
09591	After this, they were always in the driving seat.
09592	Were they under-age?
09593	He was charged with perjury.
09594	I started it, but then forgot all about it.
09595	However, there would be no permanent displays.
09596	The goal will come.
09597	He could hardly have been in greater demand.
09598	We didn't take our chances.
09599	It was all very proper and civilised.
09600	I've played them all in the Champions League.
09601	There are many children.
09602	That never seemed likely.
09603	Action must be taken urgently.
09604	Either system could have prevented the crash.
09605	But these things are happening now.
09606	I am very encouraged by this poll.
09607	They thought the set-up there was unfair.
09608	It will be a challenging film.
09609	The test case is still awaiting action.
09610	What happens next?
09611	He added, The old system has reached its limits.
09612	They're just a nonsense.
09613	There may be some resistance.
09614	I could not believe it.
09615	The Rangers think they have problems.
09616	Then there was her childhood.
09617	I thought that all musicians were the same.
09618	It's so much more fun.
09619	I believe he could have turned it around.
09620	Where do you think she is going?
09621	This looks like it's anything but open.
09622	Such is the scene of the tragedy.
09623	It's a double whammy.
09624	What's the theme?
09625	We are satisfied that this is the case.
09626	For me, it was a shattering experience.
09627	The deadline for selecting the electors is today.
09628	What's wrong with that?
09629	His remit is specific.
09630	It is a very big problem.
09631	Frustration is not the word.
09632	She was extremely rigid.
09633	I was blown out of proportion.
09634	It's the same with us.
09635	It's an awful lot of money.
09636	It's a fantastic achievement.
09637	Neither was in the squad announced yesterday.
09638	He, too, was not satisfied.
09639	I've never regretted coming here.
09640	He is in a lot of pain, it's very distressing.
09641	I am so, so, so lucky.
09642	I fell into it by accident.
09643	I only wanted to give her a fright.
09644	Where does it come from?
09645	Norman was not doing so bad, either.
09646	The world is being invited to visit.
09647	If it's not, they didn't go far enough.
09648	I think it's a sensible change.
09649	His first album was a hit.
09650	What's it for, after all?
09651	I cannot say anymore.
09652	They want this research to continue.
09653	They are going to carry it through.
09654	It was very, very dejected.
09655	I think it can count against you now.
09656	He was a legend.
09657	That's when the story first appeared.
09658	He will continue to provide support for them.
09659	I'm going to see my friend.
09660	We played too deeply.
09661	I probably would have been a dancer.
09662	We're going to see a Government in a hurry.
09663	He never asked me for money.
09664	I was a bit nervous.
09665	There was no question of him not impressing.
09666	However, we came through.
09667	I am desperate to play for Scotland.
09668	Hear what they have to say.
09669	Now there's a thought.
09670	I believe that the answer is simple.
09671	I was on the pitch and everything.
09672	Clearly the impact is going to be negative.
09673	She looked very settled.
09674	Of course he was right!
09675	But my daughter has got nothing.
09676	Nobody, if he has anything to do with it.
09677	The dangers are very obvious.
09678	I played well in my time there.
09679	They are still going to be impulsive.
09680	The scheme was simple but extremely effective.
09681	He is a very nice man.
09682	We want to sort it out.
09683	It made me determined to get back.
09684	It was no avail.
09685	We're going to see more extreme weather.
09686	He was replaced by John Spencer.
09687	Of course, we have to be very concerned about that.
09688	It was worth the wait.
09689	We must not give in to the bastards.
09690	I think it was his parents.
09691	Our commitment is to move forward.
09692	Partly, it is his own fault.
09693	It's a personal matter.
09694	That's where it all started.
09695	I won't go back.
09696	Why has it taken so long?
09697	I was proud of our lads.
09698	These will finally be corrected by next week.
09699	He leaves a beat.
09700	Perhaps it was her demeanour.
09701	It lasted longer than we thought.
09702	It hasn't happened, but other things have.
09703	The claim was denied by first minister.
09704	It has to be long-term commitment.
09705	That would be a big mistake.
09706	His arrival could be the making of them.
09707	After all, this is the start of the giving age.
09708	I said How much?
09709	You are a liar.
09710	The scheme has been funded by the Government.
09711	We're still talking about it.
09712	She would say he was still the best.
09713	He finished the night in a cell.
09714	I don't know what he was shouting.
09715	It is the icing on the cake.
09716	It was a new ball game.
09717	Previously police had said that schools were safe.
09718	The past is history, not destiny.
09719	These were the edited highlights.
09720	We could do a lot worse.
09721	Inquiries are ongoing into this incident.
09722	In the end, that was enough to beat England.
09723	That was the initial attraction.
09724	Who will take them after that?
09725	He's also thinking long-term.
09726	A kinder but effective treatment would be welcomed.
09727	Trevor has been great.
09728	It is highly unlikely.
09729	I have fallen in love with the Highlands.
09730	There will be no exceptions to this rule.
09731	Destruction came from within.
09732	It is good to look back.
09733	You can't do one without the other.
09734	Obviously we want to stop the rot.
09735	Chris Paterson was outstanding.
09736	It's not the end of the matter, of course.
09737	And they did just that.
09738	Our system is archaic.
09739	It is not illegal.
09740	I wouldn't say this is normal.
09741	That will be the case on Tuesday.
09742	This is complete nonsense.
09743	There is still hope.
09744	It's all happening at a local level.
09745	However, she is female, and so.
09746	The playing is perfectly turned out.
09747	But he did not rule out further talks.
09748	He had a horror.
09749	We're delighted and we certainly deserved it.
09750	This time we may not be seeking volunteers.
09751	That was the biggest game of my life.
09752	This is perfectly legal.
09753	Then came the second round.
09754	Saddam is not threatening this country.
09755	Parents should avoid it.
09756	And she's not even in the book!
09757	Of course it's a bunch of trouble.
09758	He, too, is killing.
09759	Bin Laden is believed to be left-handed.
09760	It's better to be happy.
09761	It's just so sad.
09762	We have lost the round, but not the fight.
09763	And Scotland is no different.
09764	It's been an extremely frustrating year for me.
09765	Is it a warning to parents?
09766	And it will be even more difficult tomorrow.
09767	Attack appears to be the biggest concern.
09768	He said he needed no more evidence.
09769	It's such a tragedy.
09770	It was a long time coming.
09771	Gordon Brown was superb.
09772	The referee didn't do his job.
09773	We are very nearly there.
09774	Stand by for action.
09775	They have been for some time now.
09776	It was only logical to end it.
09777	I've no passion for any country.
09778	That's an old idea.
09779	It is part and parcel of it.
09780	The only safe investment is cash.
09781	It's the whole season.
09782	We had no choice but to go down.
09783	We are keen to have him back.
09784	Of course, it was very passionate in Glasgow.
09785	And we all understand that.
09786	The new incitement offence will cover all religions.
09787	Clearly, the future remains uncertain.
09788	We must do well in that.
09789	She died later on Monday.
09790	No-one has yet been charged.
09791	If so, they were wrong.
09792	This is my big break.
09793	There is no easy answer.
09794	There was someone on the floor.
09795	I put pressure on him.
09796	He supported the decision to review the decision.
09797	The proposals have been taken out of context.
09798	Golf has lost a great character.
09799	However, it has had only a limited uptake.
09800	However, the report was incorrect.
09801	There was no pressure at all.
09802	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the sizes of the drops increases.
09803	They will be dealt with.
09804	It is never an easy game.
09805	I intend to raise the matter there.
09806	We have to put this behind us.
09807	I thought it was quite good.
09808	This is a disaster averted for Scotland.
09809	That is impressive by any standards.
09810	We are doing very well as we are.
09811	The waiting is over, well almost.
09812	I'm not allowed to say that, of course.
09813	It helped me to get noticed.
09814	They hit me in the head.
09815	But he is not using them.
09816	That, though, was just the start of it.
09817	We are not moving in.
09818	We have not had a formal request.
09819	Its effect on humans is not yet known.
09820	We offered something different.
09821	We were very much a happy family.
09822	He was critically ill in hospital last night.
09823	My brother's buried under there.
09824	What were they?
09825	It was large enough to fit the wall.
09826	Her role in it was small.
09827	I've really noticed that this week.
09828	It's back to how it used to be.
09829	I was chosen to do this.
09830	I learned a lot from that.
09831	Sandy was very active.
09832	However, there is great potential in this right.
09833	I'm confident of the outcome this week.
09834	Before the games it was pretty open.
09835	It really has left the town in shock.
09836	This was much worse.
09837	We are confident of taking that back.
09838	They must be kept on the ground.
09839	Did they give any good advice?
09840	Who wants to be a millionaire?
09841	This does not help.
09842	That's why the ministers resigned.
09843	He has lost confidence and weight.
09844	This could be her way forward.
09845	The Parliament will make its own decisions.
09846	It's a very, very special day.
09847	There's also the point.
09848	That's the National Grid.
09849	They've just got to believe in themselves.
09850	This is my personal assessment.
09851	Although, you never know.
09852	The quality of work is very impressive.
09853	However, he added there were signs of progress.
09854	I think the Scottish bid is very strong.
09855	Nothing is being offered in exchange.
09856	It's just one of those things.
09857	We played so well at times.
09858	I was very fortunate.
09859	Such a policy would be a disaster.
09860	We act because we must.
09861	We didn't get the supply to the forwards.
09862	O Neill is reputed to have replied.
09863	The Tory party will last.
09864	It was a journey into a new life.
09865	What's the point?
09866	Why is this?
09867	What has changed since then?
09868	Raymond was always on the outside.
09869	We need to make more inquiries about that.
09870	I'd love to be at the World Cup.
09871	He is expected to be interviewed by detectives.
09872	I'm sorry to hear this news.
09873	At some point, the bill will be presented.
09874	I mean it happens.
09875	This week is a perfect example.
09876	This performance has given my confidence a boost.
09877	Receiving this medal is an honour.
09878	Sub Not Used, McCulloch.
09879	But every two minutes it was exploding.
09880	It's typical of me.
09881	They played it like a cup final.
09882	However, it's not all bad news for women.
09883	We haven't found out anything different.
09884	A review of the decision is being sought.
09885	It will be about commitment, not compliance.
09886	Still, in the end, it was a fair result.
09887	I am ashamed of them.
09888	Glasgow, however, did not get a mention.
09889	I, like an idiot, agreed.
09890	I'm not blaming audiences.
09891	He'd never run the distance before.
09892	I can make one further announcement.
09893	Obviously, a lot has changed for me since then.
09894	It will not be easy for him.
09895	This one is a special case.
09896	But what are the songs about?
09897	There is a simmering anger out there.
09898	The stadium was full.
09899	Dewar is the medium.
09900	It was that kind of night.
09901	It is very much a matter for them.
09902	Perhaps it is jealousy.
09903	He's got a great chance of making it.
09904	We won't do that.
09905	I hope we do.
09906	From now on there is no hiding place.
09907	The United Nations must act.
09908	Sponsors include the Sunday Herald.
09909	Her daughter is getting married.
09910	His manager blamed the referee.
09911	They were that poor.
09912	Stan is a vital part of our future.
09913	That will depend on the outcome of inquiries.
09914	After that, though, we're still waiting to see.
09915	They should feel ashamed.
09916	I'm just looking to take my chances.
09917	It looks as though there is no chance.
09918	Election results are expected soon.
09919	So she told him.
09920	There are moments of honesty, too.
09921	It was good to score the goal today.
09922	The night is young.
09923	I suspect that it will.
09924	But there's no eye contact.
09925	The squad will be the same for France.
09926	We are a party for people, not against people.
09927	We're still paying the price for that.
09928	He did his best, but it wasn't good enough.
09929	It's not a wish list.
09930	He's very, very lucky to be alive.
09931	There is no margin for error.
09932	This was not an easy meeting for me.
09933	That figure will always remain with me.
09934	And then a funny thing happened.
09935	It doesn't take much.
09936	She asked us a lot of questions.
09937	It was a stunning strike.
09938	It is a technique.
09939	They hold on for many years.
09940	Is it the shape of things to come?
09941	My body is exhausted.
09942	Home is in the Scottish Borders.
09943	There is nothing to fear.
09944	World leaders expressed their sympathy.
09945	I tried to push him away.
09946	This was done by the council staff.
09947	The truth is otherwise.
09948	We haven't come out of this very well.
09949	I thought they could have made the gesture.
09950	We should be rewarded for producing.
09951	The bottom line is that this must stop.
09952	Which, in effect, it is.
09953	We feel it sends out the wrong message.
09954	Our people are paying high prices.
09955	The reason is partly because of tradition.
09956	Nor is it likely to do so.
09957	Or so everyone believed.
09958	He was in contention almost every week.
09959	Every school in Scotland should be excellent.
09960	It's up to Ann.
09961	We are playing them at their own game.
09962	By this point the couple were approaching fast.
09963	So, it took me back to boarding school.
09964	That's what we're trying to achieve.
09965	There is no more money.
09966	The rubble was right up to the ceiling.
09967	There have been different reports from different people.
09968	It's an absolute disgrace.
09969	Something was plainly wrong.
09970	Why should he go anywhere?
09971	One thing is sure.
09972	It was a foolhardy decision.
09973	I'm confident we can do that.
09974	It's funny how it comes and goes.
09975	We're talking about the outskirts of London.
09976	We have it on video.
09977	I'm not a threat to coaches.
09978	It's never over until it's over.
09979	Colonel, About this committee that is coming.
09980	This year, it was a little different.
09981	That, though, is to miss the point.
09982	We gave them the goal.
09983	Is being naturally funny enough?
09984	What's the point of staying sober?
09985	We did discuss the Lockerbie issue.
09986	The incident is being taken seriously.
09987	So what's the shape, and what's the detail?
09988	They were going through the motions, but that's about all.
09989	I'm sure everyone will be delighted for them.
09990	I'm not a fan of books.
09991	I never had any confidence in it afterwards.
09992	It was a simple question.
09993	I find this ongoing debate is demeaning.
09994	And we've beaten them before.
09995	Could you put it in writing?
09996	I'm not a paedophile.
09997	Some of their movement was excellent.
09998	The odds are that it will.
09999	That's the position that the MoD has adopted.
10000	Why is that?
10001	But will they fall in love?
10002	As if they ever stopped.
10003	The referee had a shocking game.
10004	Players are fighting to stay in the team.
10005	For a few years we had good fun.
10006	Medical staff are with them at the moment.
10007	It went on to become an annual event.
10008	We are now in an election period.
10009	Everyone's too upset to comment.
10010	Three people were pronounced dead at the scene.
10011	But when we do it is great.
10012	She has nothing to say to journalists.
10013	I didn't want to fall out with anyone.
10014	I can't believe the buzz.
10015	When it comes down to it, this is a job.
10016	It's no less intriguing, however.
10017	Staff have been informed.
10018	This morning was very quiet.
10019	On reflection, it was really quite exciting.
10020	It's been handled entirely properly.
10021	Two others were also seriously injured.
10022	He was made redundant in February of last year.
10023	Next league matches, Motherwell - Dundee United.
10024	You've obviously got an answer to it.
10025	It seems very odd.
10026	Closure is not one of them.
10027	A handful of those restrictions are in Scotland.
10028	This is an internal matter.
10029	I'm amazed at what he's done.
10030	The idea was presented to me.
10031	The hearing in Edinburgh continues.
10032	His appointment was generally welcomed yesterday.
10033	The hearing was fair.
10034	I see it as my job.
10035	This was not a summit about the euro.
10036	Frank Warren is a great man.
10037	I'm a little bit tired.
10038	That was never their agenda.
10039	She's currently in foster care.
10040	That's the only thing that matters.
10041	As it was a double, it was pretty expensive.
10042	We have been preparing all year.
10043	We could learn a lot from them.
10044	I may think about performing it.
10045	There are a number of possible outcomes.
10046	This is the last thing we ever expected.
10047	You can't go back and change things.
10048	It's time to fight a decisive battle.
10049	Instead, it's back to the drawing board.
10050	He says it often enough.
10051	Actually, he thinks he has had it pretty good.
10052	I found that much more challenging.
10053	This fight is not going to go away.
10054	It would have been very easily done.
10055	I will never manage another Scottish club.
10056	The Open champion is back.
10057	It's going to be a new challenge.
10058	I want to keep him.
10059	I knew people on that committee.
10060	The next eight weeks are critical to us.
10061	Yes, it gave me a lot of confidence.
10062	Her grand-daughter was uninjured.
10063	We never agreed to it.
10064	But that night they killed her housekeeper.
10065	But it's not the end of Scottish football.
10066	Sightings were replaced by rumours.
10067	Would they work together again?
10068	I didn't play all that well.
10069	Who can tell?
10070	It appears to have been closed down.
10071	Now, that is a good deal.
10072	The whole nation will be delighted.
10073	It's about bringing people in, breaking down barriers.
10074	Pupils and staff were sent home early.
10075	It is all about people being assaulted, abused.
10076	In fact, he didn't deliver a speech at the awards.
10077	I only half believe it.
10078	All the oil companies are talking together.
10079	I'm feeling pretty good.
10080	Rangers deserved to beat us.
10081	That, though, is the measure of the man.
10082	It was developed in the Gulf War.
10083	Sub Not Used, MacKay.
10084	The spirit in the squad is certainly good.
10085	I'm astonished the men were not injured.
10086	I've learned a lot, and tomorrow is another day.
10087	It's the most beautiful place on earth.
10088	You can't go on forever.
10089	He had a moustache.
10090	They are completely different from each other.
10091	That would be even more disastrous.
10092	You can expect a hell of a fuss.
10093	It is a pity, but you can't have everything.
10094	There are a lot of examples.
10095	But it will backfire.
10096	But then he changed his mind.
10097	I really hope he thinks that through.
10098	Police were also perplexed.
10099	It's very tragic and traumatic.
10100	For me, it's a tension you can feel.
10101	That's a huge amount.
10102	I'm not holding the club to ransom.
10103	Her advice for Glasgow is just be visionary.
10104	Folk music is in her blood.
10105	This is the high point of my career.
10106	Don't even bother applying.
10107	But perhaps we shouldn't worry too much.
10108	We haven't seen from the Bank of Scotland.
10109	The elections should have no role in this.
10110	I should not be able to stand.
10111	They've got to get better.
10112	He realises he has hit a glass ceiling.
10113	This is good news for the Western Isles.
10114	We've got the top three.
10115	Clearly we were looking at this very carefully.
10116	I certainly do not agree with that.
10117	It was a disaster of a race.
10118	No, it's never been mentioned.
10119	Our customers come first.
10120	Mixing drugs and alcohol can be extremely dangerous.
10121	Drugs are getting through.
10122	You saw the football.
10123	I am a little bit tired.
10124	We have an attorney on the ground.
10125	I looked forward to it.
10126	The text is reduced to bubbles.
10127	We don't say there was a massacre.
10128	The island will never recover.
10129	That is not an easy thing.
10130	She was a delightful person.
10131	This is wonderful news.
10132	But if they were there, they were keeping a low profile.
10133	A Scottish film studio is also being considered.
10134	That will not change.
10135	I am deeply sorry they did.
10136	Asylum seekers are still being attacked and abused.
10137	Who would have thought it?
10138	Intensive care has been very busy.
10139	It could be a danger.
10140	The alliance said it may not wait.
10141	I'm not putting myself down.
10142	I don't think we could have expected better.
10143	What are you going to do exactly?
10144	He is also a great finisher.
10145	A counter reaction was.
10146	Clearly, she says, we would never resort to such devices.
10147	We are waiting for them to calm down.
10148	Neither was involved in violence.
10149	Lucky for us, he enjoyed the experience.
10150	Hitches can be expected.
10151	He wasn't ready to cope with the pressures.
10152	No, no, it's not what you think.
10153	The whole thing would be perfect.
10154	However, we had no failures on our side.
10155	This seems like a very good idea.
10156	It was not confirmed by Scotland Yard.
10157	There is access for disabled people.
10158	We don't want to push him.
10159	I like what has happened!
10160	We are still going ahead with our plans.
10161	The European is a piece of vanity publishing.
10162	There were three boys and two girls.
10163	There is a job to be done.
10164	I can't believe what has happened.
10165	We've been treated with complete contempt.
10166	There must be boundaries.
10167	I cannot confirm the name of any driver.
10168	We can make changes.
10169	It is a comforting fantasy - but it remains a fantasy.
10170	The conclusion is enthralling.
10171	Instead, it is back to the drawing board.
10172	You name it, they have it.
10173	We are obviously disturbed by this case.
10174	We could play someone else, but he is ready to play.
10175	He feels he has cost us the game, but he didn't.
10176	It is a natural reaction.
10177	I don't believe that money is the answer.
10178	I am in a very difficult position.
10179	As for Owen, class is permanent.
10180	There is , according to a legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end.
10181	Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but the refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
10182	The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increase.
10183	Have we tried everything?
10184	We have worked hard.
10185	Naturally, she said yes.
10186	This is not a war on terror.
10187	There will always be problems on the way.
10188	Why you did it will never be known.
10189	What a week he has had.
10190	He is looking for a sporting challenge.
10191	There is a new confidence about the club.
10192	I accept that, but is very upsetting.
10193	We accept the challenge.
10194	The question is, Will it be enough?
10195	After that it is up to the boss.
10196	They were taken to prove a point.
10197	It doesn't have to be in Inverness.
10198	So, why does he do it?
10199	It is very unfair, and something should be done.
10200	That is not the case this time.
10201	They treated me with respect and courtesy.
10202	There was only silence.
10203	However, he said it would be likely to bring a chill.
10204	It doesn't look as pretty.
10205	However, our players will fight for that.
10206	Everyone was very saddened.
10207	This is a dream come true.
10208	The problem is not confined to the UK.
10209	I wouldn't give them a grade.
10210	What on earth is wrong with you?
10211	IS Tony Blair on drugs?
10212	It has certainly paid off for him.
10213	We have a major concern about the enforcement action.
10214	It is clear that change is required.
10215	Thirty schools were closed in the Western Isles.
10216	Robin Williams is subdued.
10217	The judge was very nice.
10218	They control the prices paid to farmers.
10219	Most of them have already gone home.
10220	Weaknesses there are, however.
10221	The driver escaped injury.
10222	There was no bad behaviour.
10223	It's a much bigger problem.
10224	There are no problems between us at all.
10225	Hopefully, he will be back in contention next week.
10226	I hope it comes out all right.
10227	I will just have to be patient.
10228	I kept it very simple.
10229	The rest was badminton.
10230	It will take several days.
10231	We had to push to get a goal.
10232	That got me out.
10233	We are making progress on waiting lists.
10234	It will have to ratify the deal.
10235	I did not have faith in the procedures.
10236	I was not a joiner.
10237	It has until Saturday.
10238	I've tried to get on with my life.
10239	She has the biggest part.
10240	We will win this tie.
10241	This is totally untrue.
10242	Or someone wants to say something different.
10243	I think they have to change that.
10244	This series is for real.
10245	It's great news, isn't it.
10246	It's very ingenious.
10247	It is all up to the Members.
10248	The two sets are different.
10249	And now the pressure is off.
10250	You can see the appeal of running away.
10251	Their opening was disastrous.
10252	The time is up for Iraq to comply.
10253	Too much has already been said.
10254	Now, however, things are different.
10255	It was not a beautiful game, was it?
10256	She is not the world champion.
10257	It would be difficult to argue with that.
10258	While they went on a holiday, we got the contract.
10259	He is a bully.
10260	The case was taken on by his brother.
10261	I've won the British.
10262	And frankly, it's been a while.
10263	Feel for five seconds.
10264	I hope it is a good omen.
10265	Because if it matters to them, it matters to me.
10266	They will appear again next week.
10267	We were not consulted regarding this appointment.
10268	You look at that.
10269	Things begin to spring to life.
10270	Or was it Some kind of a ham?
10271	I understood that concern.
10272	It was like a dream to be here.
10273	The four characters could be one somebody suggested.
10274	Either way, it doesn't bother me.
10275	It would help to heal the wounds.
10276	We did not deserve to go through.
10277	It's got to be in the head.
10278	It certainly sounded it at times.
10279	That happens in boxing.
10280	None of the opinions is good.
10281	We were hopeful that it would be successful.
10282	They must not succeed.
10283	He declined to provide a breakdown.
10284	I have never seen him like that.
10285	And you need to be so resourceful.
10286	Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarerry.
10287	Everything in the world was focused on London.
10288	We played better after the break.
10289	But this relative success has not been easy.
10290	It was the same with the Dickens.
10291	Of course it is still possible.
10292	Actually, it's an amazing orchestra.
10293	That, in a way, is the point.
10294	What is so unusual about this case?
10295	That would end it for us.
10296	Police are treating the incident as attempted murder.
10297	Sure, he is the best player in the world.
10298	I just love lessons.
10299	Retirement is on his mind.
10300	It's to do with this place.
10301	It is not just the agencies.
10302	Nobody is pushing out to the right.
10303	He confirmed his fitness.
10304	The gap is narrowing.
10305	All of us in Scotland should be viligant.
10306	Both men were uninjured.
10307	We are in this for the long haul.
10308	I am really sorry that he is going.
10309	But is this enough to provoke a killing?
10310	I didn't just walk in and get it.
10311	We need a much wider debate.
10312	My attitude is exactly the same as before.
10313	They went back to the seventeenth.
10314	So what could be better than becoming a captain?
10315	However, it proved to be the turning point.
10316	In hindsight, it was the wrong decision.
10317	I waited and waited.
10318	We all knew it could not be true.
10319	Its future is uncertain.
10320	I'm very surprised and obviously delighted.
10321	It doesn't look good for her.
10322	She said he did not look too happy.
10323	We are aware of the problem.
10324	Where will the elderly go then?
10325	Then it was changed without notice.
10326	He had a great game.
10327	The following year, they asked him again.
10328	It is the men who create the demand.
10329	I'm very happy indeed to be almost redundant.
10330	Every case is completely different.
10331	It's a scandal, a disgrace.
10332	It will be fine.
10333	They are you, the fans.
10334	We're just waiting for her reaction.
10335	At the end of the day, two men have been shot.
10336	What a difference a game can make.
10337	They will not be able to come back, in my opinion.
10338	Why do it?
10339	I have totally had enough.
10340	Hopefully today will be the turning point.
10341	We shall be ready for Rangers.
10342	It was bound to happen, and it has happened.
10343	There were no reported casualties on the ground.
10344	What are you waiting for?
10345	This is still happening in the US.
10346	Another issue will be policing.
10347	This is the biggest surprise of my life.
10348	She was so full of life.
10349	I should have given him one in return.
10350	The princess has strong links with Scotland.
10351	I am very confident about tomorrow night.
10352	I just wanted to fly.
10353	And he has a tale to tell.
10354	So, how did this happen?
10355	It's all a part of letting it go.
10356	I just hope it's not tonight against us.
10357	There are no quick fixes.
10358	The change was not instant.
10359	They use them for everything.
10360	Who is to benefit from this change?
10361	We are not defeated.
10362	He knows what he's got to do.
10363	It is planned for London in the spring.
10364	War and force are not the only solutions.
10365	Which brings us to the point.
10366	I think it's difficult for Bonnie.
10367	I am quite excited about it.
10368	Everyone agrees with that.
10369	She had denied the charge.
10370	Sometimes you stand on them as they collapse.
10371	I didn't feel good.
10372	It is believed that he had been stabbed.
10373	It is an expensive part of their equipment.
10374	Let's get to know him.
10375	We have got to attack.
10376	Time has run out for Saddam Hussein.
10377	It divided audiences at Cannes.
10378	How would it work?
10379	We told them in July.
10380	The film was great.
10381	The police believe that the man was not injured.
10382	Everyone in Britain is proud of this team.
10383	There was too much at stake.
10384	I read about it in the newspapers.
10385	Is that not uncanny?
10386	It has to reinvent itself.
10387	It is a good result for Great Britain.
10388	He was happy with his form.
10389	His art was not just about emotions.
10390	It's a production company.
10391	But we will not be scared.
10392	But that is not an issue for now.
10393	There will be no receivers.
10394	The air campaign is not over yet.
10395	It's a national sport.
10396	But this isn't a play about The Troubles.
10397	The picture in Glasgow was improving, he added.
10398	Only New Zealand has seen a similar increase.
10399	I was shocked and outraged.
10400	It was extremely cold.
10401	Italy would be lukewarm.
10402	People are using it in their daily lives.
10403	We have to open up.
10404	There is a review outgoing at the moment.
10405	It was just awful.
10406	We are doing okay in the league.
10407	Today the Kremlin would be contacted in seconds.
10408	It is time for concerted national action.
10409	Do you know who we are?
10410	It certainly gives you hope.
10411	If he does not leave, he will be shot.
10412	Two people have died.
10413	I am delighted to have her back home.
10414	Many of them were his friends and colleagues.
10415	It is based on his movement records.
10416	It wasn't an easy decision.
10417	It left me with sadness.
10418	There is a changing of the guard.
10419	It was our time maybe.
10420	I know we can play a lot better.
10421	We said it will happen one night.
10422	This election is far from over.
10423	Ali was shot at, but refused to back down.
10424	However, we let them back into the game.
10425	Is that such a bad thing?
10426	You do need a check and a balance.
10427	Thousands of people were missing.
10428	It's time to move on.
10429	I couldn't get out of bed.
10430	I can't describe it.
10431	But what will we put on it?
10432	It will benefit a lot of people.
10433	There may be hope this year, however.
10434	They are taking a stand against this.
10435	I think we believed the tie was won.
10436	Well, there you go.
10437	It was a great team effort.
10438	I am glad that justice has been done.
10439	Its first awards will just do that.
10440	That is my preference.
10441	It is not that sort of inquiry.
10442	I have never been overly ambitious.
10443	I hope you don't regret it.
10444	He was all blackened.
10445	This is the greatest moment of our lives.
10446	Audiences there were shocked.
10447	They responded in the most positive way.
10448	The British government said she was coming home.
10449	We won very easily.
10450	That is a matter for Mr Graham.
10451	Yet it is all for two good causes.
10452	It is so elusive and light.
10453	I am not a fan of stoppages.
10454	Is the war over?
10455	The country is in a state of chaos.
10456	The gaffer was great.
10457	Overall, however, these were also down.
10458	As far as we are concerned, he is innocent anyway.
10459	I am going home to see my children.
10460	New potential dangers were emerging.
10461	The problem is the book.
10462	They say he wants to go to England.
10463	They are the partner of choice for anyone.
10464	And what does it cost, and who is paying?
10465	This is not an optional extra.
10466	This is not the most crucial issue.
10467	We don't know much, but we are still awaiting news.
10468	Will we ever play together again?
10469	I played well but missed a few chances.
10470	We will see how he is after treatment.
10471	This is rapidly becoming a fiasco.
10472	We could not compete with Rangers.
10473	But don't worry just yet.
10474	We have got the school holidays on.
10475	This is the big one.
10476	That just wasn't good enough.
10477	Then, as we know too well, anything can happen.
10478	Our home is your home.
10479	It is essential that we win the game.
10480	There was no confusion over the second.
10481	A decision is expected shortly.
10482	You would be wrong.
10483	Mr Wilson had two brothers and three sisters.
10484	We took the chances when they came.
10485	It is important that vital services are maintained.
10486	These services may also have to be cut.
10487	We can't have it both ways.
10488	Actors stand still in the frame.
10489	A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment.
10490	How can you not react?
10491	This is excellent value for money.
10492	Thereafter he left Scotland.
10493	I was delighted with Robbie.
10494	I'll just do my best.
10495	The police were called in.
10496	The group would never be the same again.
10497	Aye, but who do you really support?
10498	He said that this is beautiful.
10499	That option cannot be ruled out.
10500	Mr Smith was dismissive.
10501	But Harry has become a franchise.
10502	I can't deny that fact.
10503	Seaman is not the goalkeeper of old.
10504	That's the whole idea.
10505	My life is a mess.
10506	He did not report it.
10507	Surely the panel was interested?
10508	This is a huge event.
10509	If only the problems concerned the players.
10510	It will be an eye for an eye.
10511	Whatever happened to that one?
10512	Here the National Gallery has been very clever.
10513	Do you want a cup of tea.
10514	The bookies have got it about right.
10515	It was always open for extension.
10516	I think we're very different.
10517	And that is not a bad idea.
10518	He also has a house in Italy.
10519	It's so creative and different.
10520	It got no better.
10521	Some reports said they had been killed.
10522	This is the start of a new campaign.
10523	The failings are serious.
10524	It is like a bereavement.
10525	I shouldn't have to put up with it.
10526	No other country has ever won this tournament.
10527	They didn't have a care in the world.
10528	In fact, it might just be beginning.
10529	There is no right to appeal.
10530	Scotland is one of the favourites, with Glasgow to the fore.
10531	The World Trade Centre was our Main Street.
10532	I feel it is very irrational.
10533	It's not that difficult, it really isn't.
10534	They were average apart, together superb.
10535	A decision is expected next March.
10536	We don't believe anything anymore.
10537	I am awaiting a reply.
10538	There was no need for such a hostel.
10539	There's no doubt about it.
10540	What's a boy to do?
10541	The other was the tabloids.
10542	I am so lucky for that.
10543	And Rangers think they have problems.
10544	We talk to each other about these matters.
10545	There will be two other areas of contention.
10546	But he has strong links to Labour.
10547	They think that it matters but it doesn't.
10548	This looks like it is anything but open.
10549	She kept him on a string.
10550	It's a long-term solution.
10551	It's a very special unit.
10552	And our game is about going forward.
10553	This wasn't something we wanted to rush into.
10554	This was not the show for me.
10555	We do not, at the moment, have a shortage.
10556	She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we can go meet her Wednesday at the train station.
10557	It helped to get me noticed.
10558	My brother is buried under there.
10559	I have really noticed that this week.
10560	I am confident of the outcome this week.
10561	They have just got to believe in themselves.
10562	However, it is not all bad news for women.
10563	I am not blaming audiences.
10564	He had never run the distance before.
10565	We are still paying the price for that.
10566	It is not a wish list.
10567	From our point of view, it is the right time.
10568	It does not take much.
10569	It is up to Ann.
10570	I am not a threat to coaches.
10571	I am not a fan of books.
10572	And we have beaten them before.
10573	I am not a paedophile.
10574	That is the position the MoD has adopted.
10575	Everyone is too upset to comment.
10576	I disagree entirely with the decision.
10577	They've been wonderful to me.
10578	It has been handled entirely properly.
10579	He was made redundant in February last year.
10580	You have obviously got an answer to it.
10581	I am amazed at what he's done.
10582	She is currently in foster care.
10583	We have no plans for direct action.
10584	Film music was never the same again.
10585	It was a deeply moving musical experience.
10586	Now it is much easier.
10587	However, on the other hand, in principle it is plainly wrong.
10588	This is the best way to do it.
10589	Leisure centres were also affected.
10590	Meantime, the department is proposing structural changes.
10591	They discussed how he might get involved.
10592	And this perception might find an unlikely supporter.
10593	They were not up to speed.
10594	We know the quality of life goes up.
10595	What is next?
10596	The first was excluding Sinn Fein.
10597	Mackie was at home, unable to watch.
10598	So, what's it about?
10599	We have been let down by these people.
10600	Nor does he have any desire to be.
10601	How well did they get on?
10602	I don't think it is a drawback.
10603	They may have been murdered.
10604	We didn't try hard enough, that is all.
10605	It also condemned the suicide bombers.
10606	It is very difficult.
10607	This is the place to play football.
10608	Most of the others were in their twenties.
10609	We were beaten by the better team today.
10610	I mean they have just been a disaster.
10611	That is my personal view.
10612	These things just happen.
10613	And, within itself, it is visionary.
10614	Are you up for business?
10615	It's an interesting debate to get going.
10616	You are not in any kind of trouble.
10617	Will they fall out?
10618	He was not able to talk to us.
10619	There is no conflict of interest.
10620	It does seem a mystery.
10621	Club rugby refuses to die.
10622	He could look after himself, but didn't.
10623	The decision was designed to shock investors.
10624	We are not dealing here with refugees.
10625	I've had a very long run.
10626	No passengers were on board.
10627	If it does it means he has failed.
10628	I have been to see him.
10629	I would never say anything against her.
10630	He probably would not have added, mainly by me.
10631	We are in a very strong position.
10632	It was no more than they deserved.
10633	I'm just glad that no-one was hurt.
10634	Everything was a dead end.
10635	What exactly is your job?
10636	New blood is essential for progress.
10637	I said, What does this mean?
10638	We can do both.
10639	They should not have behaved in that way.
10640	There are so many people to thank.
10641	The stakes are high.
10642	We have done a deal with IMPACT.
10643	In the eyes of the supporters, there has been a betrayal.
10644	He was married with children.
10645	Rather than just a way in, she begins with an entrance.
10646	Nothing like this has ever happened here before.
10647	It was a good atmosphere.
10648	It was an accounting error.
10649	She is not in a coma.
10650	There is no reason to put me out.
10651	But they were unable to respond in time, officials have said.
10652	Post offices are closing now.
10653	Lack of pace is his big problem.
10654	The process itself has taken over.
10655	We had a huge response to that campaign.
10656	But who cares?
10657	The conference will run from Wednesday until Sunday.
10658	He predicted the contest would be very close.
10659	My life would be a lot less restrictive.
10660	The key issue for us is public safety.
10661	Nobody wants to stop people enjoying themselves.
10662	I went home and wrote about it.
10663	These are exciting times for young Scottish players.
10664	Maybe they will show it next year.
10665	Everything is up for grabs.
10666	Thankfully, for me, the matter is now closed.
10667	Are we here?
10668	He said to me, Which one, son?
10669	There is nothing sinister in it.
10670	It is having a big impact.
10671	I was not happy about being left out.
10672	The same goes for Russia.
10673	What do you think of the hair?
10674	Meantime, his appointment has been widely welcomed.
10675	It all changes for her.
10676	Is it a threat to union?
10677	We also have to work the dark side, if you will.
10678	We remain confident that Danny is still alive.
10679	No decision has yet been made.
10680	Maybe his time has gone.
10681	I have never seen anything like it.
10682	We were a little bit nervous.
10683	The plot is changing as time goes on.
10684	I don't want to hear any excuses.
10685	My mother was getting on at me.
10686	But it wasn't to be.
10687	Then there is the terrain.
10688	It's such a shock.
10689	I didn't know there was anything wrong.
10690	She was totally possessed.
10691	Everyone thought they were safe.
10692	People wouldn't have quite understood the language.
10693	However, pensions and salaries have yet to be settled.
10694	At the same time it is a satire.
10695	Talks will then resume again in the autumn.
10696	This is a critical time for football.
10697	I think she is supreme.
10698	This is totally out of character for Stuart.
10699	He asked how they were doing.
10700	We have been extremely lucky this time.
10701	I'll have to work on that.
10702	He must be seen to be impartial.
10703	I don't have any more contact with Airdrie.
10704	There is great interest on our island.
10705	Later they changed their minds.
10706	Hours later, she was found dead by Ms Wilson.
10707	I want to go home.
10708	That, however, was only the tip of the iceberg.
10709	Of course he does!
10710	The Farmer is called an idiot.
10711	We didn't make any of this up.
10712	The house was full of smoke.
10713	A decision about that will be made today.
10714	Now it's all written down.
10715	The Dutchman was suspended for two games.
10716	The commission is not the only loser.
10717	I wish it well.
10718	Since then physicists have found it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
10719	The message was clear.
10720	She is an angel.
10721	It is believed he had been stabbed.
10722	There we were on the first tee.
10723	The police believe the man was not injured.
10724	It would be a miracle.
10725	We just love to chat.
10726	We will continue to pressure the Government.
10727	His voice is strong.
10728	But they add up.
10729	The Insider opens tomorrow.
10730	More patience and composure was required.
10731	We're still in talks and, hopefully, they will continue.
10732	I am immensely proud of them.
10733	I can't believe it.
10734	I couldn't believe it, but it looks like it's true.
10735	We have them in offices all over.
10736	There has been a sense of frustration.
10737	That'd be good for the whole city.
10738	We are very very proud of Alain.
10739	It was set in a cafe.
10740	Brown is an interesting man, but he's not desperate.
10741	We've all been there at some point.
10742	I'm totally horrified by the sentence.
10743	Hopefully they will turn out tonight.
10744	Thousands of others have not been so fortunate.
10745	What she will do next?
10746	Hopefully, everything is for the best.
10747	That is a data management problem.
10748	Nor is he allowed out without permission.
10749	I've beaten her a few times.
10750	This is not a long-term commitment.
10751	Yet she is one of the lucky ones.
10752	I'm the one that said it.
10753	It's not hard to get involved.
10754	I've grown up a bit.
10755	It's a difficult one to comment on.
10756	Our position is clear.
10757	Yet it does not lose appeal.
10758	Then in came a succession of signings.
10759	It's not just a male agenda.
10760	She wanted to move.
10761	It's always a rehearsal.
10762	We all have to look in the mirror.
10763	About the bad things that happened to me.
10764	We are already under pressure.
10765	The Scottish management team will settle for that.
10766	He didn't have long to wait.
10767	It would be really interesting if they did.
10768	I love the Scottish and the Irish people.
10769	I want to be there by right.
10770	You've just got to move on.
10771	I feel really good.
10772	So You Think You Want to be Victoria?
10773	It's just the workings of the Scottish media.
10774	These people just lost their child.
10775	It may now be too expensive for anyone.
10776	Was this a new event?
10777	We're still hopeful of concluding the deal.
10778	His style is suited to Scottish football.
10779	You're going to take away my life.
10780	Smith confirmed that their confidence was returning.
10781	I was very, very happy.
10782	No-one should see that.
10783	We are going to go about our lives.
10784	They made it very difficult for us.
10785	Well, there is a bed.
10786	You write a play.
10787	Seems a sensible compromise.
10788	I'm happy with the outcome.
10789	The real problem is the Usher Hall.
10790	My family, health and golf is always a balancing act.
10791	My game just seems to keep on improving.
10792	We would expect it to disappear in time.
10793	I'd love to have been on the pitch.
10794	She's now on the back benches.
10795	But there are some problems.
10796	It should not lose out in any way.
10797	We're very pleased about the verdict.
10798	It will not be today, though.
10799	Which is a shame.
10800	That is where our future lies.
10801	Sure, this is a very important event for me.
10802	We have to adapt to this level.
10803	So what is it with Nato?
10804	The observer saw no evidence ofr fighting.
10805	It makes a huge difference.
10806	They should use it on the catwalk.
10807	Perhaps it is the Crown Estate.
10808	We're looking at the Citizens Theatre the Lyceum.
10809	Anyone can take a photo.
10810	He is involved in everything.
10811	Family, if you like.
10812	I don't want to change anything.
10813	He did, and he missed.
10814	It's our worst nightmare.
10815	You never had it so good.
10816	The then secretary was not amused.
10817	I'm really looking forward to it.
10818	Capital gains tax is also being reduced.
10819	He's on the wrong side.
10820	Labour is providing none of these.
10821	Finally action had been taken.
10822	Broke down and can't be fixed.
10823	I'm desperate to play in this match.
10824	But sometimes it works out all right.
10825	I have to keep working hard.
10826	That is difficult to answer.
10827	Wrong decisions Address in full
10828	My father had been unwell for many years.
10829	So is the rest of British sport.
10830	It's not a solo.
10831	We know you will not let us down.
10832	I didn't have a clue.
10833	I am still pretty young in this business.
10834	I was there for five hours.
10835	There are no excuses.
10836	He just wants to play.
10837	This kind of problem arises everywhere.
10838	The news was yesterday welcomed by union leaders.
10839	They could not hear.
10840	That is different from being impartial.
10841	The other children were severely mentally impaired.
10842	Perhaps they knew something we didn't.
10843	It will be a great night.
10844	That's the way it is.
10845	I am not a magician.
10846	She had experience of the wildest places.
10847	It is a scandal.
10848	But these were the nights.
10849	We did not talk about it.
10850	The court has not decided.
10851	We find this very sad.
10852	I'm really happy with the way it went.
10853	It is a step on the way.
10854	This is my new career.
10855	It really was a masterful innings.
10856	There is no change in our position.
10857	We must learn from the past.
10858	I have no comment to make.
10859	I hope he stays.
10860	He doesn't do dinner.
10861	That's a very strong element.
10862	We are taking it seriously.
10863	The manager is there to make these decisions.
10864	I'm feeling very pleased.
10865	Clearly, that is important in nursing.
10866	We have nothing to hide.
10867	It might have been a satanic ritual.
10868	I'll take the blame for that.
10869	That is absolute nonsense.
10870	You don't do the same thing with men.
10871	Pray that it is so.
10872	They probably expected something special from me.
10873	But we could not change his mind.
10874	It is a dilemma.
10875	They did not interfere.
10876	He was not seeking special advantage.
10877	What will happen if it all goes wrong?
10878	I was backing him up.
10879	That was their attitude.
10880	It was nothing to do with my daughter.
10881	They could move in at any moment.
10882	There were no reported injuries.
10883	It is my nature.
10884	I think it is a release of tension.
10885	I want to help other women.
10886	The problem is Labour.
10887	I am here to play football.
10888	That is the crunch.
10889	Everything has the potential to be serious.
10890	This will be great for the young lads.
10891	There's nothing for the kids.
10892	Creative, expressive football was the order of the day.
10893	The conductor, too, will have adjustments to make.
10894	Wallace was in at the deep end.
10895	So, how will it be received in the US?
10896	The government was consulting interested parties, he added.
10897	Above all, he was knocked out by the choir.
10898	It's much more dynamic.
10899	The reason, of course, was Iraq.
10900	Was society doing enough?
10901	They have worked with each other.
10902	That will alter the dynamics of Scottish politics.
10903	It was horrible, but there is still more.
10904	He urged Mr Blair to get out more.
10905	Euro The single currency is a fact.
10906	A board of inquiry has already been convened.
10907	It has all been positive.
10908	It's not one or the other, you have to have both.
10909	No government has that right.
10910	Billie was yet to be born.
10911	This is a good result for them.
10912	She was right about the struggle.
10913	I think the euro has slipped.
10914	We began to walk down.
10915	I will not take you out of context.
10916	We are not far from a deal.
10917	You remember how long he lasted?
10918	Ordering online was very easy.
10919	I think it is a great idea.
10920	All these women were actors.
10921	What happened to me last week was wrong.
10922	To a level which we consider appropriate.
10923	That is the first thing we need.
10924	A national strike would be dangerous and damaging.
10925	We have to concentrate on three points tomorrow.
10926	You would fall over, he said.
10927	Mr Finnie, however, said his hands were tied.
10928	We must all play our part.
10929	Last night, the centre issued a statement to the contrary.
10930	The question is, Is that a negative?
10931	He will decide tomorrow.
10932	That is our main aim.
10933	For this government, reform and resources go together.
10934	That was quite an interesting part.
10935	Chris is big and jolly.
10936	I do not want to wait until May.
10937	The festival idea has been a great success.
10938	We all work for nothing.
10939	It is extremely popular with families.
10940	The committee's remit is far reaching.
10941	She is very upset.
10942	We have to learn lessons from these things.
10943	They might want to play.
10944	Today's agreement will help tackle that problem.
10945	It is the way they work.
10946	He wouldn't do it.
10947	If only we had known.
10948	He was located after going to Singapore.
10949	She was my big sister.
10950	Then all was revealed.
10951	You guys are not out of it yet.
10952	Their welfare is very important to us.
10953	It's nothing to do with me.
10954	You have to work with what you've got.
10955	O Leary now intends to take a holiday.
10956	I have no problem with that.
10957	But who shot the president?
10958	Too many factors are now working against him.
10959	We have nothing to say about that.
10960	Peter, of course, refuses to conform.
10961	It will come up here.
10962	The chief constable is right.
10963	I didn't expect to get one.
10964	This is only the start of my season.
10965	It sounded awfully like panic.
10966	John was a very nice man.
10967	The jury is still out on this one.
10968	Then it was the turn of the carnival.
10969	But the tragedy did not stop there.
10970	They wanted to show what they could do.
10971	It was different from our other work.
10972	That is in the public domain.
10973	The Hague is too good for him.
10974	In just a fortnight, however, everything has changed.
10975	They didn't take you to mass graves.
10976	Maybe he will act again.
10977	That's why he visited.
10978	It needs somebody to give way.
10979	Whatever he does, however, it will be decisive.
10980	This is our way to make our point.
10981	It was a disaster.
10982	All the people thought that he would die.
10983	No-one else is like Michael Jackson.
10984	The post will run for four years.
10985	He had reason to be pleased.
10986	The Scots are great.
10987	However, in Orkney, there was a mixed response.
10988	I will certainly be having words with him.
10989	She is a valuable member of the Government.
10990	Christians in Pakistan are terrified.
10991	That's been our position all along.
10992	There are no charges.
10993	His funeral is not expected until next week.
10994	I am very, very happy.
10995	He just carried on filming.
10996	I didn't mean to kill her.
10997	In less than two months, the women have achieved a lot.
10998	This area is perfect for children.
10999	No, they have not.
11000	The feeling between the two men was mutual.
11001	There was no happy ending.
11002	Now it has been eclipsed.
11003	It has come as a bombshell.
11004	We still don't know.
11005	Or some thought that they have.
11006	A Treasury spokesman derided the Tory charge.
11007	It could not be too high.
11008	But Annika is just amazing.
11009	Our job is to change that.
11010	That is very, very bad news for our nation.
11011	Nobody can change it overnight, but you can make a start.
11012	What's it all about?
11013	It is a big time for me.
11014	There were two things going on at once.
11015	That is the key message.
11016	This is the subway.
11017	Altman has every right to be bitter.
11018	It is a weakness, and not the only one.
11019	He's in with the furniture.
11020	What's it got to do with them, anyway?
11021	There are a few changes.
11022	It has to be funded.
11023	We know we can't rely on you.
11024	Arguably, they have already done it.
11025	It was indeed a night to remember.
11026	It doesn't appear to be anything too serious.
11027	There is something in this.
11028	There are no plans to change this.
11029	It's going to be quite a challenge.
11030	I have heard the stories from Scotland.
11031	It is just too long since the war.
11032	My wife is totally behind me on this.
11033	We are the British National Party, not the English National Party.
11034	I will carry on.
11035	I made a mistake.
11036	I think that could work to our advantage.
11037	Was that not awful?
11038	The Government has to grasp the nettle.
11039	We will just get on with it.
11040	We are worried about casualties.
11041	This is my music.
11042	I haven't won the world title.
11043	It's fantastic to have finally won.
11044	I am not changing my event.
11045	That is as it may be.
11046	You encourage them - you can do it.
11047	The winner will be announced by early summer.
11048	I always said No.
11049	He was different from the rest of us.
11050	Tartan Day is not a Scottish event.
11051	So now you know.
11052	But, at the same time, they made you think about life.
11053	We have obviously got some work to do.
11054	Which he can do.
11055	And we're talking Big Money.
11056	With Pierre, you can never be sure.
11057	There was a great support all round the route.
11058	Both managements are very supportive.
11059	This is important for two reasons.
11060	It's been like that for ages, according to the guys.
11061	Is that where we are?
11062	There was no energy behind it.
11063	They have not allowed them to defend themselves.
11064	I get very excited by that.
11065	In the end, it will mean an awful lot.
11066	However, there are signs of dissent among his collies.
11067	There's nothing for you here.
11068	I have not come in to take over.
11069	I want to win this thing.
11070	Three months or so later, they are returning.
11071	It was no surprise.
11072	We could feel the heat.
11073	He was a member of the Tartan Army.
11074	I wanted to win so badly.
11075	The offer of help is there for anyone.
11076	Times have changed, but have they improved?
11077	Later we discovered it was a hoax.
11078	It could take three days.
11079	It was totally my fault.
11080	Tomorrow night is the important game.
11081	He's very good at relating to adults.
11082	It was a move which appealed to him.
11083	It was very personal and very intimate.
11084	Maybe that was the whole point.
11085	They will pass it on to Jim Wallace, the justice minister.
11086	We already have them, all over Europe.
11087	I thought they played very well.
11088	We should just say no.
11089	I didn't make those adjustments.
11090	He told the conference.
11091	It's not one for the purist.
11092	This could be a recipe for conflict.
11093	We are taking advice on this.
11094	It was just an accident of birth.
11095	I've no doubt about it, it was actually from her.
11096	The world is split into two.
11097	It was so physical.
11098	He always has been, since his early days with the Scottish Opera.
11099	It is extremely sad.
11100	Europe is a hugely contentious issue.
11101	And therein lies the whole problem.
11102	He was not deterred.
11103	But the Premiership is everything to us.
11104	But we have come under attack.
11105	That is his attitude to things.
11106	And what was that like, as an experience?
11107	No finals are to be contested today.
11108	This is not a struggle against Islam.
11109	It is in our own hands.
11110	We may make a short-term appointment.
11111	I'm not changing my mind.
11112	Tony Blair is obviously panicking.
11113	We welcome this increase in the minimum wage.
11114	The approval system will be changed.
11115	I can't blame the fans.
11116	So far they have refused.
11117	He took my breath away.
11118	It's good fun, and makes it so much more interesting.
11119	This influence, to the audience, is like an arrow.
11120	It had won an investors in people award.
11121	He was to get his chance.
11122	I'll always remember the horrible images.
11123	That's why they go to the opera.
11124	The trouble is, though,there is no simple solution.
11125	I am getting long in the tooth.
11126	He was sentenced to seven years.
11127	I would recommend it.
11128	Charles Gordon, leader of the Glasgow City Council declined to comment.
11129	She'd gone to the Catholic school.
11130	Where was their passion, the power and feeling?
11131	This is a lie.
11132	They'll have to pay more.
11133	It's the taking part that counts.
11134	People are fed up.
11135	It's a sign of the times.
11136	Once we have done that, the tender will be put out.
11137	The public have been very supportive.
11138	It seems a little short to me.
11139	I welcome this new service.
11140	Then it developed into civil and criminal.
11141	The law should be changed.
11142	I will be standing.
11143	The attack was totally unprovoked.
11144	The plot is simple.
11145	They've not let anyone into the loop.
11146	Looking at him is proof of the pudding.
11147	I knew he was dying.
11148	He's a key player in Scotland.
11149	He loved his children.
11150	She wondered why we were interested.
11151	An appeal was made to the presiding officer.
11152	This, too, could provoke a risky business.
11153	We have always been, and remain confident of the securing of order.
11154	This man is serious about his work.
11155	Liberal Democrat leader makes the hash of it.
11156	They are a very powerful and tasty side.
11157	I'm delighted for Simon.
11158	Here we have not had one hour.
11159	I just don't know where he is.
11160	Golf is an expensive game for beginners.
11161	He would take up the bike.
11162	He sat down at the piano.
11163	The sun is worth a million dollars.
11164	I'm sure they love it.
11165	We are going to change our party.
11166	The hangover was Olympian.
11167	We are here for the long term.
11168	More likely, perhaps, is that he will stay in England.
11169	It's not realistic because it's early days.
11170	Let's not go overboard.
11171	I only half believed it.
11172	On reflection, it is more than that.
11173	They couldn't believe what had happened.
11174	This must be wrong.
11175	I am delighted to hear this wonderful news.
11176	It is a family day out.
11177	It's just for me.
11178	History is usually written by the victors.
11179	That would be dangerous.
11180	They're completely different from each other.
11181	He was extremely nervous.
11182	We still don't know what's happened.
11183	A win was a real achievement.
11184	Suddenly, directing was the thing he wanted to do.
11185	I am prepared to help make it happen.
11186	This is not presently the case.
11187	Mummy believed in one thing above all.
11188	But the price has been very high.
11189	Where is the structure?
11190	There's still time for that.
11191	Teams are always interesting to watch.
11192	That wasn't for me.
11193	I am delighted with today's win.
11194	Next time around, it will be different.
11195	That is a brand name.
11196	It is best value.
11197	That has not changed.
11198	We are not ruling it out.
11199	This doesn't have to be our future.
11200	I think he was surprised.
11201	That gives us a bit of a chance.
11202	I have good memories of Glasgow.
11203	We can do nothing about that.
11204	Or rather he did and he didn't.
11205	Government sources said, It is building up.
11206	Arsenal considered the job done.
11207	On occasions he succeeded.
11208	I'd never be free.
11209	Luckily for us, he enjoyed the experience.
11210	We will be stronger in Berlin.
11211	It is so damaging.
11212	We have rebuilt and reformed.
11213	It was certainly intense.
11214	He refused to discuss his imminent retiral.
11215	He denied that taxpayers money was involved.
11216	It feels like too much.
11217	There's no support for it at all.
11218	It's really nothing new.
11219	There is no going back.
11220	Courtenay took over on tour.
11221	If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed forms yellow.
11222	I am very happy with the result.
11223	It is deeply worrying.
11224	Are we not men?
11225	How could it not?
11226	Another former manager, Bobby Robson said.
11227	We are proud of them.
11228	That incident altered the pattern of the game.
11229	It was pretty special.
11230	Whatever we are doing, they have good reason to come.
11231	I should say so.
11232	Yet therein is the problem.
11233	This isn't a new problem.
11234	There can be no dispute about our history.
11235	The crowd was waiting.
11236	It was a joy.
11237	It's the same with cinema.
11238	I have been there many times.
11239	They enjoy playing the game.
11240	It is not standing army.
11241	The second is freedom.
11242	Get used to it.
11243	But we will learn from that.
11244	We couldn't afford it.
11245	The issues are not going to change.
11246	Would you have ever believed that was possible?
11247	I don't think it is.
11248	There are no other contenders.
11249	We have to get this sorted out.
11250	Singing is my first love.
11251	When is it ever anything else?
11252	That is unlikely to happen.
11253	This is not finished.
11254	It was one of the firemen.
11255	Don't you believe it.
11256	I want to keep playing.
11257	That is how we will be judged.
11258	We are getting there.
11259	He, too, is keen to redress the balance.
11260	It's almost certainly not going to help.
11261	Why does it come out now?
11262	It's better than that, it's fantastic.
11263	Everyone in front of me was dead.
11264	I have thought a lot about the Commonwealths.
11265	It's very hard to plan for it.
11266	He is that good.
11267	We did not have a clue.
11268	We need to be more specific.
11269	This is the man who provides the hope.
11270	He has been banned from the Salmon Inn.
11271	Then there is the Mini itself.
11272	It's good for the city.
11273	Because he usually is.
11274	I hope he gets it.
11275	I am here to work for Scottish Labour.
11276	I can't do anything before nine.
11277	However, they should not come as a surprise.
11278	It could last five months.
11279	Everything is accounted for.
11280	The support from the general public was astounding.
11281	About time too, you might think.
11282	We have made mistakes and were badly punished.
11283	We've got a mixture of both.
11284	I'm very happy to be here.
11285	This is not the case.
11286	This one was supposed to be so different.
11287	It has been difficult for her to do, he says.
11288	Cloning is not ready.
11289	New Labour are running scared.
11290	Don't hold your breath!
11291	Safety is our first concern.
11292	Inspections are not the problem.
11293	I've been enjoying it, though.
11294	I'm trying to be relaxed about the future.
11295	It's part of the end game.
11296	Do they play for the money?
11297	The claim was denied by the first minister.
11298	More than that, it's a vicious circle.
11299	And how much of a compliment is that?
11300	I have friends in Glasgow.
11301	There's nothing to be gained by it.
11302	We have been through this with the lawyers.
11303	I'm not interested in the job.
11304	The warnings were a good reminder.
11305	The biggest resource is our staff.
11306	How will we get there?
11307	She told me to stop.
11308	I wish him well for the future.
11309	The lads are having a tour.
11310	These were the dreams.
11311	But we must work in harmony.
11312	There is no other way.
11313	I don't have any regrets about the edit.
11314	That does not mean we have failed.
11315	He has refused to do that.
11316	This is a personal decision for me.
11317	When will you listen?
11318	I'm happy that we have agreed.
11319	All of them were killed.
11320	Not that it is unique.
11321	Some injustice was committed.
11322	I didn't expect to be in.
11323	I reckon he won't make the mistake again.
11324	I am not a liar.
11325	The cause remained a mystery last night.
11326	I had no experience at all.
11327	Yet he remains confident enough.
11328	I just made it.
11329	There was no secrecy.
11330	Even then it might be difficult.
11331	It was complete nonsense.
11332	It is three years.
11333	They are not always the same person.
11334	This is a very special moment for me.
11335	It is a daunting task.
11336	But he made a mistake in picking it.
11337	This is an appealing record.
11338	This is a problem we have to tackle.
11339	No person has been charged.
11340	One paper was not returned.
11341	I don't want to do too much.
11342	We don't have money to get to town.
11343	We have great support.
11344	One would not want to go there anyway.
11345	And it's difficult to argue.
11346	There is a problem.
11347	They are very concerned, and you can understand that.
11348	Was it too obvious?
11349	Wouldn't it be nice?
11350	It is a terrible thing to have happened.
11351	The work was suspended following the kidnap.
11352	She becomes a mother.
11353	He is very much respected within the group.
11354	People want to learn.
11355	But it was fun.
11356	Inside, there is a kind of madness.
11357	I'd like to run.
11358	I am a player.
11359	He was not alone.
11360	Who wouldn't do it?
11361	We are all in the frontline.
11362	Further expansion is possible.
11363	I'm interested in all kinds of history.
11364	We know we have the quality.
11365	It may be the first of many.
11366	It runs in cycles.
11367	I spoke to him yesterday.
11368	We are looking very hard at ourselves.
11369	I am not going to sit back.
11370	But this is even worse.
11371	The truth is he probably doesn't.
11372	There were few surprises.
11373	He is a one-off.
11374	She is having an affair with his partner.
11375	The pressure is enormous.
11376	I am not that sadistic.
11377	Are you all right?
11378	I'm certainly thinking about retirement.
11379	But we say Yes - and we are the people.
11380	Is it any good?
11381	It would be that absurd.
11382	As if he would.
11383	I just carry on with my work.
11384	His attacker has been a Rangers fan.
11385	He wants the festival to make a difference.
11386	The auction has seven days to run.
11387	They want to prove a point.
11388	Would he ever go back to the beginning?
11389	What is going on?
11390	We thought we were looking in good shape.
11391	Tonight is very special.
11392	This is a matter of life and death.
11393	Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a sack for her brother Bob.
11394	It's a big mystery.
11395	What is a house without it?
11396	It's about the balance.
11397	It really has not been their season.
11398	I want somebody with something to prove.
11399	There was a ban on reporting the trial.
11400	I don't think the action was a mistake.
11401	You go in there and do it.
11402	We were in Italy suddenly, we knew.
11403	What will happen to them today?
11404	It was electric, amazing.
11405	I said to him.
11406	Labour has been found out on public spending.
11407	he told a producer.
11408	That is not the place for her.
11409	We have to work together.
11410	I don't think that he won't be released.
11411	It means it is difficult.
11412	But they were true stories.
11413	I needed to get away.
11414	I will make that point tonight.
11415	There are two things we have to do.
11416	Are they going to work together again?
11417	We need to do that every week.
11418	But what did it matter?
11419	Hopefully it will be tomorrow night.
11420	I am not retaining him.
11421	It has affected it, obviously.
11422	And he's not a bigot.
11423	But summer is spent.
11424	Services are being expanded, too.
11425	It is extremely fortunate.
11426	Today is the first step in that process.
11427	That should be fun.
11428	What we were doing.
11429	It all happened so suddenly.
11430	I won't let that happen.
11431	Or have they?
11432	There is no change in the strategy.
11433	I am not completely insane.
11434	We spoke about a few people.
11435	She had to learn a new discipline.
11436	In fact, he took it very well.
11437	Quite a lot of people know that, actually.
11438	We did it in one take.
11439	What will it be?
11440	The search is due to be completed today.
11441	What you sow, you have to reap.
11442	Six men will take the decision.
11443	To have Mr Clinton is quite an accolade.
11444	We should not be surprised at that.
11445	We have been so lucky.
11446	It was all over now.
11447	But it was only a matter of time.
11448	I always liked to get a laugh.
11449	I still hope to go.
11450	We're not that bad.
11451	Today is a victory for the Scottish Parliament.
11452	There are exciting days ahead.
11453	We're very, very happy.
11454	There could be a possible connection.
11455	But there was everything!
11456	That imbalance was evident in their play.
11457	However, the drama was not over.
11458	But it was not just the land.
11459	We are still waiting.
11460	It happened again yesterday.
11461	He will be a major challenger next year.
11462	That question was never asked.
11463	I am not inclined to believe it.
11464	How can they tell?
11465	My ambition is to make the cut.
11466	It will be for the committee to decide.
11467	Rangers must be winners, it says.
11468	He was part of the family.
11469	But it does not matter.
11470	Sadly, he has a point.
11471	It was so sad.
11472	Mind you, all was not lost.
11473	We were extremely lucky.
11474	It was an amazing time.
11475	The hearing is expected to continue today.
11476	It is just a matter of time.
11477	This news is really depressing.
11478	I'm not fit for anything else.
11479	The day may come, but not for a while.
11480	The enemy was time.
11481	He would have done the same to me.
11482	What were they told?
11483	More cases are expected.
11484	My condition is not bad.
11485	Tomorrow is a big day for Scotland.
11486	I would like to make an impact, of course.
11487	The goal is clear.
11488	Just think about the lines.
11489	It all depends on the wind.
11490	I was very influenced by him.
11491	This was certainly not about money.
11492	A film is different from a book.
11493	Within three days he was dead.
11494	You'll find out on Saturday.
11495	We know that from recent experience.
11496	This could be wonderful.
11497	He loved it, and so did they.
11498	The other was a football match.
11499	They have the players to do it.
11500	He has made a step forward.
11501	That was very important.
11502	This will have to change.
11503	It was a very strong metaphor.
11504	We are going to have a party.
11505	I'm very happy that it exploded.
11506	Lester was like that.
11507	Look at New Labour, it hasn't worked.
11508	That's a matter for them.
11509	We were never told it was already decided.
11510	It is part of our heritage.
11511	It is not as simple as that.
11512	Find them somebody they deserve.
11513	We're not getting involved.
11514	The lottery has helped.
11515	They know the language.
11516	You cannot do that in a lobby.
11517	We will all suffer as a result.
11518	Without doubt, they can win the title.
11519	What's it about?
11520	We are looking to the future.
11521	The signs are positive.
11522	I called it right.
11523	It has to be put in context.
11524	I think we can get there.
11525	No, they have played well.
11526	The reaction of staff has been fantastic.
11527	The answer is obviously no.
11528	I'll take it as it comes.
11529	I think we're the better side.
11530	There are two mysteries.
11531	I could have been killed on that day.
11532	It is very enjoyable.
11533	Now, that would impress the kids.
11534	But that is for another day.
11535	It was not like that at all.
11536	Police are appealing for witnesses.
11537	I was very surprised.
11538	We all knew they could do it.
11539	It's about taking risks.
11540	There are not too many like him.
11541	The memory is there.
11542	It was an amazing experience.
11543	The police are hopeless.
11544	We are deeply concerned at the announcement.
11545	That's the important thing.
11546	Should he resign?
11547	They have to live with the risk.
11548	It is, but that's not the point.
11549	It was my whole life.
11550	It was a classic.
11551	However, it is going to happen.
11552	This time it really could happen.
11553	It does nothing for me.
11554	But that's another story.
11555	I think it has worked.
11556	No other family members could be contacted.
11557	There is nothing to be gained from that.
11558	We're very proud of him and his achievement.
11559	But do not rely on it.
11560	What do you want.
11561	That prevented any recurrence of the problem.
11562	I think we could do well in Europe.
11563	And yet, there has been no great impact.
11564	I'm not there yet but it is close.
11565	But it will not work again.
11566	Even then he wanted to deflect attention.
11567	I have nothing to say on that.
11568	The rest is his own.
11569	I have no worry about that.
11570	It turned out to have been three hours.
11571	That is exactly right.
11572	That is not good for golf!
11573	We know the goals will come.
11574	But it did not last.
11575	We have nothing to lose.
11576	The first time it was rejected.
11577	No-one can take it in.
11578	They were following his orders.
11579	That is an entirely different discipline.
11580	It was an insult.
11581	Yet there is hope.
11582	Referees in Scotland are very weak.
11583	That was a fairy tale.
11584	I would love to do that.
11585	You'll have to wait and see.
11586	It wasn't the issue.
11587	The number never came.
11588	I really have to go now.
11589	We are going to listen to Britain.
11590	There isn't much of a scene in Austria.
11591	Words are not enough.
11592	We have expected it.
11593	Well, that was the plan.
11594	The problem is fairly serious.
11595	No decisions have been taken.
11596	It's the body that counts.
11597	Sprinters are not fit.
11598	This has been coming for weeks and weeks.
11599	Let's not make that mistake again.
11600	That's why he is the prime minister.
11601	Only injury has prevented that happening before.
11602	They have to be dealt with.
11603	So what was he really doing?
11604	I don't want to go anywhere.
11605	How do we get a bigger stage?
11606	We're very close to being a good team.
11607	I thought their commitment was superb.
11608	My mind is the most important thing now.
11609	I had nothing to lose.
11610	I thought to myself.
11611	We're talking to the US.
11612	Thereafter they were again in control.
11613	You have to keep the focus alive.
11614	It could have been a ceilidh.
11615	I cannot really commit.
11616	Sadly, so did a couple of errors.
11617	This is a new beginning.
11618	He is doing just that.
11619	But there are signs of a revival.
11620	I thought it was a great game.
11621	Just get on with it.
11622	Germany also said it was unimpressed.
11623	It shows the Government is listening.
11624	They want it to work.
11625	They still have a great sense of humour.
11626	He was at the outset of his career.
11627	Our position is quite clear.
11628	It could now be up to the courts.
11629	We can make a difference.
11630	This was not a contest.
11631	So far the weather has been very pleasant.
11632	Breaching that condition was itself an offence.
11633	I cannot describe it.
11634	It is not designed to kill.
11635	We'll have to be satisfied with it.
11636	Gordon Brown did not inherit a mess.
11637	It is good football in Scotland.
11638	There is no other option.
11639	You can feel the tension in the air.
11640	It is about more than Scotland.
11641	It's not just going to be busy.
11642	She was so supportive.
11643	I'm delighted with our performance.
11644	We await a decision.
11645	It is an investment in our product.
11646	What would you ask?
11647	We have got to deal with it.
11648	Where do we spend it?
11649	I don't know how she does it.
11650	I saw it later in the news.
11651	Now we must look to the future.
11652	I didn't play badly.
11653	They are looking for partners.
11654	We should have been rewarded for producing.
11655	I am also delighted for all the players.
11656	He did very well, but didn't win.
11657	There is no shortage of questions.
11658	Couldn't see the point.
11659	Others have tried to explain this phenomenon physically.
11660	It would be nice.
11661	We are not prepared to do that.
11662	We've just decided to do something about it.
11663	But it's not just about that.
11664	He was very close.
11665	But someone has to take them.
11666	We don't find any danger from them.
11667	They were appalling, disgraceful.
11668	Who was that?
11669	We didn't deserve to win.
11670	This is great news.
11671	That was a month ago.
11672	It would be another reason to live.
11673	I felt under a lot of pressure.
11674	But it was no problem.
11675	This has been a difficult time for me.
11676	Where is the money coming from?
11677	It needs a rethink.
11678	Why does it work?
11679	He would have been wrong.
11680	He played really, really well.
11681	He was right of course.
11682	That, however, was the exception.
11683	This has been a long process.
11684	It's probably just as well.
11685	It is time for the talking to stop.
11686	We were very close.
11687	If only it were so.
11688	They do not deliver.
11689	However, that is just for starters.
11690	This can be extreme.
11691	Would she remember the music?
11692	Mr Masterton said he was very hopeful.
11693	He is now back in Britain.
11694	There was no commission.
11695	It is time to be realistic.
11696	But we never wanted to do that here.
11697	The money will go straight to the headteacher.
11698	He said, we're delighted by the vote.
11699	This is a terrible tragedy.
11700	I'm delighted to be coming back home.
11701	He said he never saw it.
11702	He did not have to stop and think.
11703	We deserved to win it.
11704	Or did it?
11705	His own excitement is never difficult to detect.
11706	He almost admitted as much.
11707	So what is the problem?
11708	We believe it to be completely without merit.
11709	He didn't bother a soul.
11710	That was my first reaction.
11711	Fishing is a declining industry.
11712	Are there any he wants to play?
11713	The film is on a tightrope.
11714	I have never been in anything like that.
11715	We have got to the top.
11716	And it worked, so we kept it.
11717	Yes, we can beat them.
11718	You need that freedom in society.
11719	Who do you think will win?
11720	I certainly would not accept this decision.
11721	This research is extremely promising.
11722	Weather conditions were good, he added.
11723	He was shaking like a leaf.
11724	How did he know?
11725	He will have to live with his words.
11726	They are working very well.
11727	He is advised that he has done so.
11728	Annika is very, very fit.
11729	This is not quite right.
11730	It really is tremendous.
11731	This is a recipe for disaster.
11732	The wind was coming from all directions.
11733	So we started building a home.
11734	It will not happen overnight.
11735	What then is wrong?
11736	My brother is not like that.
11737	He was very fit.
11738	It was very exciting.
11739	As far as we're concerned, the matter is closed.
11740	It is no more than a shell.
11741	And did they have sex?
11742	But he was a really nice man.
11743	It was very close.
11744	It gives us hope.
11745	We can't determine that clearly.
11746	Are you the man from The Herald?
11747	And that's it?
11748	Of course the ending was fantastic.
11749	I want to be frank.
11750	Yet it seemed to work.
11751	I think it was just a tragic accident.
11752	We haven't been able to go and see.
11753	It works, as well.
11754	I can't say anything.
11755	This was all well and good.
11756	This is a disaster for us.
11757	What does that mean?
11758	This is your life.
11759	He can be beaten.
11760	He had been on holiday visiting his grandmother.
11761	Why does he do it?
11762	They are very clever and very dangerous.
11763	We lost out a little bit.
11764	I had just taken it off.
11765	It was properly reported to us.
11766	He was outstanding today - the best player on the park.
11767	Everything happened so quickly.
11768	I am feeling a bit better.
11769	Everyone here is heartbroken.
11770	We have no further comment to make.
11771	This produces exactly the opposite effect.
11772	You have to keep it on the fairways.
11773	I don't like to fail.
11774	I really didn't think he would.
11775	He may have a long wait.
11776	They have already done that.
11777	Later, a very different story emerged.
11778	So it should be.
11779	It's hard to say.
11780	Her heart was not in it.
11781	They are now collapsing.
11782	Government funding is not a problem.
11783	We just did not want to believe it.
11784	The medal itself is not that important.
11785	The time for change is now.
11786	They deserved to beat us in the replay.
11787	We've got to get this right.
11788	They set up to win the hole.
11789	Let's make this clear.
11790	It was quite simply, delicious.
11791	I can't believe it happened.
11792	Thankfully it was cleared up.
11793	The game will be at a football stadium.
11794	They were his words.
11795	People were very confused.
11796	We've had a lot of adjusting to do.
11797	I am very relieved.
11798	The people have been really friendly.
11799	Aberdeen were difficult to break down.
11800	That, though, is not true.
11801	I hope he comes back.
11802	They made up for it on Saturday.
11803	That was our mission.
11804	The second half was a different affair.
11805	I've done it all.
11806	They've had a good start as well.
11807	One thing is clear.
11808	We might never see him again.
11809	They were very unfair to him.
11810	I have spoken to my brother.
11811	And that is very good indeed.
11812	We could have had no new money.
11813	It wasn't really like that at all.
11814	What will happen to them now?
11815	The Dream is as hard as they come.
11816	We are not collecting.
11817	I thought the dancing was over.
11818	I think they have got it completely right.
11819	There is a lot of fear.
11820	I've heard it all before.
11821	We are not there yet.
11822	We will not give up on the truth.
11823	Sub Not Used, McCall.
11824	Now they had it.
11825	She died a few days later.
11826	What is their concern?
11827	The difference was amazing.
11828	But it is historic.
11829	I have still to hear about that.
11830	I'm going to win the next two.
11831	You know it was good fun.
11832	They want that school.
11833	They have not changed at all.
11834	One is investment, one is reform.
11835	Structural changes will never be enough.
11836	That was always the danger.
11837	Will they fall in love?
11838	There was nothing sinister in that.
11839	But don't just take my word for it.
11840	Is that what it's about?
11841	And the audience is a surprise.
11842	They worked on it for three hours.
11843	Let's make him a show.
11844	I'd never heard anything like it before.
11845	Would that be for men and women?
11846	The government agreed to pay.
11847	It was a very terrible thing.
11848	Let's not take too much for granted.
11849	It has been an extremely long haul.
11850	I'll need to discuss it with my family.
11851	She is deeply distressed.
11852	Well, there can be no complaints about this one.
11853	They said they would.
11854	You know the score.
11855	I am an innocent man.
11856	The improvement today was fantastic.
11857	I'm looking forward to coming home.
11858	But he did not appear.
11859	The time was right.
11860	It all happened so quickly.
11861	It is working well.
11862	He said nothing of the sort.
11863	It simply doesn't happen.
11864	We wanted to do something different.
11865	I love it here.
11866	Things are on track.
11867	Frankly it was disgusting.
11868	It is a tragedy for the area.
11869	He was not entirely correct.
11870	I'm sorry if any offence has been caused.
11871	There are not enough of them.
11872	It has been a frustrating one.
11873	But we wouldn't want them any other way.
11874	What's in a name?
11875	They are expected to be released today.
11876	We were all afraid.
11877	I hadn't had that before.
11878	That is to miss the point.
11879	It will be a new experience.
11880	I didn't see it.
11881	IT had to happen.
11882	It is a challenge for all of us.
11883	I don't believe in God.
11884	It's good to be back.
11885	It wasn't the second one.
11886	Detectives are still working on the case.
11887	I reported it but nothing was done.
11888	There was much to be positive about.
11889	It wants them to go home.
11890	Yet the improvement in behaviour was huge.
11891	My daughter was really, really innocent.
11892	It will not be easy.
11893	And it will be a challenge.
11894	The power of religion is so strong.
11895	It means a huge amount.
11896	It is a good result.
11897	It was one New Year.
11898	Our policy is already working well.
11899	That's interesting to me.
11900	The injuries are not too serious.
11901	That was no surprise to me.
11902	This has been blown out of all proportion.
11903	There is no escape.
11904	Labour accused the Tory leader of panicking.
11905	This is the crossroads.
11906	He is pretty upset.
11907	Where is the human rights?
11908	It is time to give her a rest.
11909	It's a difficult one to play.
11910	We are seeing a Government in a hurry.
11911	It is a great honour and a privilege.
11912	It was love of Helen and the children.
11913	The lady is right.
11914	Their condition was described as stable.
11915	It was to no avail.
11916	You shouldn't have a stoppage in November.
11917	I'm working on that.
11918	We must not give in to bastards.
11919	Nobody ever knew it had happened.
11920	I've already done that.
11921	It has to be a long-term commitment.
11922	No such remedy has ever been pursued.
11923	Felt good about it.
11924	What's the big idea?
11925	He was a soldier.
11926	It didn't get any better.
11927	I'm not saying he is finished.
11928	That probably wouldn't happen at Liverpool.
11929	We believe we have a strong case.
11930	I lost it at the final whistle.
11931	It doesn't make sense.
11932	I'll go back home and see my family.
11933	He said Mr Holland was a disgrace.
11934	She became very good at it.
11935	The manager knew me very well.
11936	We've got a full house tonight.
11937	If they don't, they won't get what they want.
11938	Make sure you see it.
11939	We are aware of the two incidents.
11940	It was just one of those things.
11941	Calderwood would agree with that.
11942	No-one thought about this.
11943	This is very bad news.
11944	We do need to get the message across.
11945	That did not go down well.
11946	For his opposite number, this was just triumph.
11947	We have to go for it.
11948	I'm surprised that it has taken this approach.
11949	I've already got them in.
11950	Nothing was going to go right.
11951	And it's not funny.
11952	They have learned from that.
11953	That gave us some confidence.
11954	Story time is over - it's a war.
11955	Things are going very well.
11956	You have to have some hope and faith.
11957	He needs to be.
11958	Since the physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows.
11959	Many contemplated ideas about the rainbow have been formed.
11960	I've got a long way to go.
11961	I'll go to the races.
11962	We will be back next year.
11963	I was very, very pleased with our display.
11964	It is a crucial award.
11965	People don't feel safe, including me.
11966	What can you do?
11967	I go in for the parts.
11968	It should be the reverse.
11969	We are a team of hard workers.
11970	And you know something?
11971	We've all been here before.
11972	I had troubles with the producers.
11973	He is trying really hard.
11974	I have no doubt about that.
11975	It is a beautiful country.
11976	I don't believe in gesture politics.
11977	The decision is purely down to the clinic.
11978	I'm just delighted to take it.
11979	This happened on three days inside a week.
11980	I am ready to go.
11981	We are still suffering from that.
11982	We are at the crossroads.
11983	They were at school together.
11984	I am looking forward to getting home.
11985	I didn't understand it.
11986	No one was listening.
11987	I will report in the spring.
11988	It's terrible that this is happening.
11989	He's got the same story.
11990	It is par for the course, of course.
11991	And so it goes on.
11992	The winner will be announced next month.
11993	What was this?
11994	Frankly, the party was not being honest with itself.
11995	I am not a doctor.
11996	It is all in the mind.
11997	I've got to get noticed!
11998	Not that it was needed.
11999	It's up to them to decide.
12000	But we can't have a casino.
12001	I would love to play in Europe again.
12002	The hearing was expected to last six weeks.
12003	This decision is destroying my family.
12004	We reckon we can do very well.
12005	It has been a great day.
12006	We are not with you.
12007	The answer is maybe.
12008	I haven't been able to do it since.
12009	It's about doing things.
12010	That was a good effort.
12011	He had finally had enough.
12012	But not all were so defiant.
12013	We are not going to get carried away.
12014	I told that to the police.
12015	On the other hand, the poster did not help.
12016	But when we do it it is great.
12017	I'm going to win the gold.
12018	It always had to be about the gym.
12019	It is a traffic warden.
12020	That never came to court as a charge.
12021	The latter way is my way.
12022	It is one of those things.
12023	Do they have to create seven majors?
12024	That began as an accident.
12025	It is, though the law is not clear cut.
12026	He will want to utilise the midfield.
12027	This has been very frustrating for him.
12028	The talking cannot go on too long.
12029	I hope that that will be forthcoming.
12030	But experience is a wonderful thing.
12031	Footage has been passed on to the police.
12032	Of course, there was still much to be done.
12033	If he does, he has a real chance of gold.
12034	It was good today.
12035	That tells you something.
12036	It has been a magical moment.
12037	These days are over.
12038	Or so it is hoped.
12039	Entries from the event are still being accepted.
12040	That has proved to be a lasting lesson.
12041	Children also died in Britain.
12042	He said he would appeal the sentences.
12043	If he leaves, the band is finished.
12044	I didn't actually work up a speech.
12045	But he kept on repeating it.
12046	They were understanding and thoroughly deserved their win.
12047	The service will only survive with change.
12048	She has not returned to work.
12049	He is the saviour of South Africa.
12050	The players are obviously keen to do well.
12051	Men should avoid it like the plague.
12052	It's really good fun.
12053	Our positions remains unchanged.
12054	We are expecting a big crowd.
12055	We did not complete the process.
12056	He died later in hospital.
12057	It's still got that at its heart.
12058	Actually, nothing much will change.
12059	There were too many mistakes.
12060	It was totally out of the blue.
12061	Horses are not affected.
12062	It went on forever.
12063	And they are different.
12064	He knows the course.
12065	We are all suffering.
12066	There was no argument.
12067	She is a valuable member of Government.
12068	We are talking about one family.
12069	Everything is so new.
12070	It may take time to get it back.
12071	The answer is yes.
12072	I believe in debate and dialogue.
12073	I would rather say nothing at the moment.
12074	He had a decision to make.
12075	It's the whole package.
12076	This has got to stop.
12077	There is no point of looking any further.
12078	It is a real concern.
12079	Is it the flight?
12080	Scotland doesn't even have a target.
12081	They really shouldn't have put it out.
12082	A compromise is essential.
12083	It was not a cover-up.
12084	The children continue to talk to us.
12085	Green is desperate to play on The Open.
12086	What on earth is happening to rugby?
12087	It is now being examined.
12088	It is so out of character.
12089	Otherwise we would all pay the price.
12090	Our thoughts are with her.
12091	It is time, he said.
12092	Everyone believes in it.
12093	He was a one off.
12094	It is my last chance.
12095	That fight begins today for the freedom and liberty.
12096	He didn't let me down.
12097	You have been warned.
12098	The Shadow Chancellor is always on holiday.
12099	It wasn't good, but we'll get better.
12100	They will be up for it for sure.
12101	So you let me know.
12102	That will just be the beginning.
12103	No one can say that about me.
12104	That had not happened on this occasion.
12105	We will need to look at that.
12106	It comes down to the police in England.
12107	There's a hint of classical.
12108	Surely they were on a hiding to nothing.
12109	The warning was lifted late last night.
12110	There is always the smell.
12111	I have to take some of the blame.
12112	And if he hasn't become a musician?
12113	He is lying to save his skin.
12114	He really has everything, including a beautiful swing.
12115	The call was ignored.
12116	It has happened, and that is the end of the story.
12117	And there is another problem.
12118	That is the theory.
12119	It almost certainly is.
12120	Because it's a secret.
12121	It just isn't a defining issue for them.
12122	Each one is as good as the other.
12123	There is no formula.
12124	I love the feel of the place.
12125	This is a new era.
12126	All the people here are local.
12127	It's a lot of pressure on me.
12128	We had to laugh.
12129	I'd rather be singing Verdi.
12130	Rangers are struggling and their team have injuries.
12131	However, there were some alarming findings.
12132	It was time to act.
12133	Others said he had gone too far.
12134	We expect them to deliver for us.
12135	They were willing us to get a second.
12136	No casualties were reported.
12137	The classes are taking place.
12138	There will be no threat to the game.
12139	That is part of athletics.
12140	Who would have known.
12141	I had to lie.
12142	Everyone was writing me off.
12143	But her parents will never see her again.
12144	I have nothing to lose.
12145	He would have loved it.
12146	All our futures will already have been decided.
12147	I believe that so strongly.
12148	He was at it again yesterday.
12149	However, his involvement was instant.
12150	It has to work.
12151	There's something about being cut off.
12152	I was going to help with the dinner.
12153	Would you pay to come and see it?
12154	I have been thinking about that this week.
12155	Let's get it on.
12156	Everyone is deeply shocked by this appaling accident.
12157	We just want a fair deal.
12158	I'll just have to live with that.
12159	He is the Acting and Deputy First Minister.
12160	It is sad and frustrating.
12161	Finding the answer is a hugely enjoyable experience.
12162	The whole matter is done and dusted.
12163	I don't know where that one came from.
12164	I was on my own.
12165	They were part of our own family.
12166	It doesn't exactly have the same appeal.
12167	I don't have any perspective on it.
12168	Scotland has lost a great man.
12169	His name has not been released.
12170	It plainly does not work.
12171	See the amazing arrogance of this, they say.
12172	Normally it would be four minutes.
12173	But the damage had been done.
12174	No, you couldn't make it up.
12175	However, he did not stay there very long.
12176	And so they have.
12177	We don't have a solution to the problem.
12178	But it won't be the same.
12179	It is a hobby for me.
12180	It was like a kick in the belly.
12181	Directing, if you like.
12182	That will be the case.
12183	We don't know what happened.
12184	They had seven children.
12185	That in itself is an erotic experience.
12186	It's all too early.
12187	I never want to have any children.
12188	Business has never been so bad.
12189	I know my sons.
12190	It was too close to call.
12191	But who is the killer?
12192	The devil, of course, will be in the detail.
12193	But it is looking very positive.
12194	He would have come into the house.
12195	I want to put myself on discussion also.
12196	It happens in real life.
12197	And we will do it.
12198	It's a human tragedy.
12199	I am going to fight to the end.
12200	It's the right thing.
12201	But this is just the start.
12202	I believe in the Union.
12203	But he is not hopeful.
12204	It will be all about the Olympics.
12205	They are very frightened.
12206	The game was up.
12207	Rangers are my life.
12208	There are two options.
12209	Surely it should be the other way round.
12210	No injuries were reported.
12211	It is not surprising, but it is appaling.
12212	It is understood he had been stabbed.
12213	THE waiting game continues.
12214	I don't think he was being very fair.
12215	You've got to fight to stay up.
12216	But this is different.
12217	It doesn't look good.
12218	It doesn't make a whole lot of difference.
12219	There is enormous interest in Scotland the Brand.
12220	And they still have the final to come.
12221	But that is about to change.
12222	We can build on that.
12223	We are not going to be complacent.
12224	His body was found in May.
12225	My wife is coming over at the weekend.
12226	Somebody has to speak up for common sense.
12227	But they miss the whole point.
12228	I was a local hero.
12229	It will be extremely difficult for him.
12230	It's a gigantic con.
12231	I didn't know she could do that.
12232	I can't say anything about any figure.
12233	They were not missing much.
12234	It's always a dilemma.
12235	Is she in trouble?
12236	But could it afford to run it?
12237	I am very happy with him.
12238	I was waiting for that question.
12239	I just want to do the good work.
12240	I'm very happy tonight.
12241	Now it was serious.
12242	No one would believe him.
12243	We live in shorthand.
12244	I just know it's a lot.
12245	I am very happy.
12246	There was no discussion about it.
12247	It was a very big win for us.
12248	We had a good time.
12249	I was utterly hopeless at it, it must be said.
12250	This was a good performance.
12251	It is not simple.
12252	The Government would be ready, they said.
12253	I said at the time it was wrong.
12254	Anything that was going, really.
12255	He will take it in his stride.
12256	I don't believe a word of it.
12257	The winner will be announced in December.
12258	This is bound to happen.
12259	Suddenly, there was an audience.
12260	And therein lies the problem.
12261	Or is it?
12262	They are appealing for witnesses.
12263	It is quite simple.
12264	His instructions were clear.
12265	There is ample evidence.
12266	It was a game we had to win.
12267	There is still a long way to go.
12268	It was still there last night.
12269	And look at the leading conductors, he says.
12270	I'll have to go out and impress.
12271	The message is just not getting through.
12272	One thing is certain.
12273	No-one said anything to me.
12274	It is a hangover effect.
12275	This is my life.
12276	I'm looking forward to that.
12277	We are in the business of selling tickets.
12278	I don't want to come down.
12279	I felt we needed to bring that in.
12280	I just wasn't very good.
12281	I certainly believe we can do it.
12282	They've got a sort of unwritten contract.
12283	British officials said they could not say.
12284	My ambitions are still with football.
12285	It's not right of Labour.
12286	They might also be reviewed by their colleagues.
12287	You can never tell.
12288	I have just got to get back.
12289	Players want to know what is on offer.
12290	It's in the eyes.
12291	Working with him is like working with myself.
12292	Six months later, they returned to Scotland.
12293	I think it is a great shame.
12294	And we were right.
12295	I know nothing about that.
12296	Britain is a peaceful nation.
12297	Our future was his future.
12298	It has made a difference.
12299	As it happened, it was much more than that.
12300	You realise what this means?
12301	They were only there for three weeks.
12302	They didn't find anything.
12303	The members have clearly spoken.
12304	I believe in God.
12305	We can't win a big game.
12306	I just want to get rid of it.
12307	I don't think they can complain about that.
12308	I have not seen the term immediate.
12309	We have to win every game.
12310	Both sides will be aware of this.
12311	We are getting people into work.
12312	Who are the democrats?
12313	We know we can defend it.
12314	Instead we were shot in the back.
12315	This isn't a gimmick.
12316	There was mystery back then.
12317	They have been very lucky with the ice.
12318	We are not the first to be affected.
12319	The devil is in the detail.
12320	We can't go home.
12321	It was a pretty terrible day.
12322	His track record is impressive.
12323	Clearly it is very disturbing.
12324	I just wanted to get off the course.
12325	Things are meant to be.
12326	One year later, he finally decided to act.
12327	This is already happening.
12328	We have a rehearsal.
12329	Only he's not as young as he looks.
12330	The matter is under discussion.
12331	In part that reflected the times.
12332	That is not true.
12333	I didn't deserve to be sent off.
12334	We have no excuses.
12335	- Really you will !
12336	This is wrong, but it's what is believed.
12337	What's the problem?
12338	The way forward isn't going to be easy.
12339	I will be ridiculed.
12340	This time it was out of the blue.
12341	We need to get the right people in.
12342	We were not going to take that risk.
12343	Last night he became one of the hunted.
12344	But that isn't what is worrying the Farmer.
12345	In my opinion, it was not working perfectly.
12346	But, still, it wasn't working.
12347	That was my mistake.
12348	We can play better than that.
12349	My whole family is.
12350	I think we can overcome it.
12351	The other question is why the scaling down?
12352	It's just a fact.
12353	They will be ready.
12354	He is walking free.
12355	There is nothing they can't do.
12356	It certainly was a birthday to remember.
12357	If you can work, you should work.
12358	THE Paragon Ensemble is back.
12359	They might also be parlous.
12360	The other is the existence of male colleagues.
12361	It is not an escape.
12362	He is very confident at the moment.
12363	They will be seen for years to come.
12364	I'm really happy with how things went there.
12365	He will be greatly missed.
12366	Sadly, they don't seem to know.
12367	But is that possible?
12368	It was really frustrating.
12369	I am just grateful he is alive.
12370	This is a special place for me.
12371	This was a great result for us, a big result.
12372	This was an hour before the show.
12373	It is crucial to understand this in context.
12374	Another one said the couple came from Inverness.
12375	I went away to recover fully.
12376	It's not a new device.
12377	Six years is too long.
12378	It's a very important and beautiful day.
12379	I have had a lovely summer.
12380	Which is fair enough.
12381	The problem is worse in Scotland.
12382	We just want them home.
12383	His was the best performance of the day, after all.
12384	I think it is a scandal.
12385	Perhaps it was just as well.
12386	I grew up with them.
12387	It was the train coming.
12388	The case was continued.
12389	That is important for the club.
12390	Now he is in charge of this.
12391	They want to play in the World Cup.
12392	He was embarrassed about what he did.
12393	He is under no illusions.
12394	That is a matter for the Scottish Parliament.
12395	Now we are back on top of Europe.
12396	I want to create events.
12397	The old manager, he didn't like me.
12398	It was like being in prison.
12399	That is very important to people.
12400	There he goes again.
12401	There were moments of humour too.
12402	All my family are in Scotland, from Glasgow.
12403	This is not a message from ministers.
12404	We have been very patient.
12405	I don't take that view.
12406	That was not the norm.
12407	We were used to being in control.
12408	He's had a lot of injury problems.
12409	Brady lost to Sullivan one hole.
12410	She thought she was going to die.
12411	You are going to go to jail.
12412	It is a very worrying report.
12413	It was an ongoing exercise.
12414	I would love to see it back there.
12415	He then did just that.
12416	Then you see it.
12417	There is good quality.
12418	He will be really pleased about this.
12419	He also seems to have been around forever.
12420	Others are expected to do so soon.
12421	Seven people were already in custody in France.
12422	It's my initial background.
12423	That has not been the case, as we now know.
12424	But he seemed to enjoy the challenge.
12425	It's getting to me.
12426	So we talked about that for a bit.
12427	I am proud of my team.
12428	I am a doctor.
12429	It will carry on.
12430	Our season is not over.
12431	Money is not everything in life.
12432	It will make a big difference.
12433	The Government has listened.
12434	It can be frightening.
12435	He was, but only just.
12436	I believe she was elected unopposed.
12437	The cause is just.
12438	Our message is getting through.
12439	She makes me so happy.
12440	I am happy for her.
12441	They were just too good for us.
12442	Police are appealing for witnesses to the accident.
12443	But it didn't happen.
12444	All were believed to be adults.
12445	What is it about this series?
12446	You read it right.
12447	You find it bizarre?
12448	I am very excited about this season.
12449	But is he?
12450	So it's a daily struggle.
12451	I am not sure.
12452	The plane was shaking.
12453	We will be pleased to talk to them.
12454	I'm going to take it further.
12455	You can never take a win for granted.
12456	That depends on Rangers.
12457	There are two problems.
12458	It's something which is very important to me.
12459	For once he was wrong.
12460	He would not have to explain.
12461	I want to deliver a learning society.
12462	We are just happy that hasn't happened.
12463	It's not been a good year.
12464	A similar exercise is expected in Scotland.
12465	I have no intention of resigning today.
12466	That has now gone.
12467	Donald is genuine in trying to be inclusive.
12468	This will take up to nine months.
12469	And maybe they have.
12470	Is he conscious?
12471	But we are confident.
12472	That's a concern to me.
12473	That will be important.
12474	But here it is also very bad.
12475	The incidents are not believed to be linked.
12476	But there is no easy option.
12477	But it would say that.
12478	Most of the works are small in scale.
12479	He was pronounced dead at the scene.
12480	Only the bomber was killed.
12481	Nor was it a game without its lessons.
12482	The bombing begins in five minutes.
12483	That took two weeks.
12484	It's worth it, though.
12485	That perhaps is behind the problem.
12486	I have to hand it to the bank.
12487	The question was simple enough.
12488	The voters rejected us.
12489	Nothing is going right at the moment.
12490	We never publicise it.
12491	He became enchanted with the process.
12492	This year the exercise is being repeated.
12493	They couldn't keep it together.
12494	We will continue to provide support for them.
12495	I've always been very taken by the drink.
12496	It was looking bad.
12497	That's what makes it interesting.
12498	It's not a game.
12499	Buildings are about people.
12500	There is much work to do.
12501	It was the dreaded sentence.
12502	I have never considered it.
12503	It is harder than you think.
12504	I am looking forward to it.
12505	It is looking very special.
12506	People were hitting the floor.
12507	It has no place in football.
12508	It is frustrating that we cannot do that.
12509	This is a classic.
12510	I'm not thinking about anyone else.
12511	It was all very good stuff.
12512	But they are a good team.
12513	We have a long way to go.
12514	I knew that we needed to get out.
12515	It is a fantasy.
12516	That's the way they are.
12517	We are trying to be realistic.
12518	That was the theory.
12519	Or so it seemed.
12520	That was worth it.
12521	What's it going to be then?
12522	Who was being affected?
12523	Our players are exhausted.
12524	It is deeply frustrating.
12525	This has been carried out.
12526	Our time is up.
12527	But other Ministers are not convinced.
12528	No, we were not exactly favourites.
12529	Conditions were very difficult for the players.
12530	This solution is not being considered in Scotland.
12531	I didn't think we deserved to go out.
12532	However, we will have to wait and see.
12533	I told them they shouldn't say that.
12534	I don't know how they do it.
12535	But the action is about to be restarted.
12536	It was extremely difficult.
12537	And the results were impressive.
12538	The next game is today.
12539	Hopefully it will be a good day.
12540	I was a silly bastard.
12541	There is an ongoing problem with this company.
12542	Was the punishment excessive?
12543	I could easy do that.
12544	We are really impressed.
12545	I try to be clear in the narrative.
12546	You have to wait.
12547	I did not see anything to begin with.
12548	It's their moment of choice.
12549	Maintain the highest standards.
12550	What could we do?
12551	There are some good people in there.
12552	But it won't make a difference.
12553	I'm not going to blame the band.
12554	I think that he got the message.
12555	Here it was very subdued.
12556	Stardom is a funny thing.
12557	They are protesting, but they know it cannot go on.
12558	The atmosphere in the dressing room is superb.
12559	I'm really looking forward to that.
12560	It is dangerous and it is a lie.
12561	We didn't, and it worked for us.
12562	No-one has used it since then.
12563	The baby was dead.
12564	We should have no more problems.
12565	An announcement is expected soon.
12566	It was one of those things.
12567	I can understand that.
12568	But sometimes it was even worse.
12569	That's a big reduction.
12570	I was pleased about that.
12571	It's a creative energy.
12572	We are not conducting the review.
12573	It just never comes together.
12574	The club has never won it.
12575	It will be a huge difference.
12576	The characters are always the first attraction.
12577	So what's it all about?
12578	I think he was lost for words.
12579	I want to celebrate the World Cup.
12580	And what happens?
12581	It is all very upbeat.
12582	We deserved the draw.
12583	Just one of those things, we suppose.
12584	No one was injured.
12585	We have had our debate.
12586	It is part of his game.
12587	But it was too late.
12588	They were all on a mission.
12589	You will gain from that.
12590	It makes me feel difficult.
12591	We couldn't believe it at first.
12592	It can take a long time.
12593	I don't intend to do so now.
12594	He is having a nightmare.
12595	Players have to accept this.
12596	He is completely committed to us.
12597	Neither had the public.
12598	I have no further comment to make.
12599	Those were the days.
12600	A press conference is about politics.
12601	It was important to bring them all together.
12602	These things happen in football but shouldn't.
12603	We know the fight is going to happen.
12604	Is it on a building site?
12605	That is the key.
12606	I am in a good position.
12607	I have never been unemployed.
12608	We are in it for the long-term.
12609	But it didn't bother me.
12610	I believe it will happen.
12611	He did it well.
12612	Why have you decided to get married?
12613	Is it all real?
12614	He will be missed.
12615	I would not descend to that level.
12616	I'm really proud of her.
12617	What does this mean?
12618	We are not physical at all.
12619	I've been waiting a long time.
12620	The meaning is very profound and complex.
12621	You just have to get on with it.
12622	We are looking for Scotland to be inspired.
12623	I don't mean in a frightening way.
12624	He is a sort of a mystery figure.
12625	I have learned a lot.
12626	He has yet to receive a reply.
12627	Hopefully, it will be good enough.
12628	For me, any manager is good.
12629	I have no idea.
12630	This plan is all about respect.
12631	I don't think he played his best.
12632	Pakistan denied the report.
12633	It will be up to the government.
12634	That is a tragedy.
12635	But this is nonsense.
12636	There will be no backing down.
12637	That must have had an effect.
12638	They have brought in the replacement.
12639	How did it all come about?
12640	We are working so hard.
12641	Our position is extremely simple.
12642	Where did that finish?
12643	I suppose it is quite exciting really.
12644	I would not do that.
12645	Lots of them haven't recovered that far.
12646	That has to be allowed.
12647	He has never let them down.
12648	There was no-one of the required standard.
12649	That would be very good for Rangers.
12650	She has never been back.
12651	They are not going away.
12652	Having done it, he was asked again.
12653	I think he will.
12654	The package is a changing one.
12655	I'm working on that one, too.
12656	Frankly, that's not good enough.
12657	What's the difference?
12658	It meant a lot to us.
12659	Their families are gone.
12660	I didn't do it.
12661	They're all doing it.
12662	No, they are not the same thing.
12663	In football it is not always the case.
12664	Sometimes we find a person.
12665	They could have been told in advance.
12666	And what do we have?
12667	It is a relief.
12668	That is the difference.
12669	You will need it.
12670	There is so much at stake.
12671	It has great potential.
12672	Still, it is a very good result for us.
12673	And he's not alone.
12674	What was all that about?
12675	I intend to end it on a high.
12676	What she can't have is the money.
12677	I thought they played well.
12678	This is not the end.
12679	And they went on to win the title.
12680	Now, she will not be running at all.
12681	It's not an impression.
12682	This was great for our sport.
12683	I don't think they are too serious.
12684	They need time to think.
12685	Something has to be done.
12686	That is where the damage has been done.
12687	The results were very clear.
12688	I decided it is going to be William.
12689	But we need to keep it there.
12690	I am really ready for it now.
12691	This decision is folly.
12692	And this was well known?
12693	It took two minutes to respond.
12694	So, we have to go back.
12695	I'm sure he does.
12696	He was found again almost a year later.
12697	The answer was wrong.
12698	They need to be helped.
12699	I am the fastest player on the course.
12700	It is an important step forward.
12701	That is the way it is.
12702	That was something else.
12703	This resulted in the following.
12704	I want to deal with this stuff.
12705	We will be patient but we will win.
12706	As good as they come.
12707	It is not for me to say.
12708	I thought it was quite a positive result.
12709	Nobody else is at risk.
12710	We are not going to back off.
12711	They said there was nothing.
12712	They were looking for things.
12713	I've got to be better than that   Quite.
12714	As it should be.
12715	We have never been short of volunteers.
12716	But who is it?
12717	Workers will now be balloted on the offer.
12718	It just isn't there.
12719	Drama is not one of them.
12720	It's just a failing service.
12721	We all want to be left alone.
12722	I was saying, No.
12723	I knew him a little.
12724	They just have a go.
12725	If it's going in, it goes in.
12726	Nobody called me to explain.
12727	You didn't get a modified.
12728	He knows he is good.
12729	I welcome the decision.
12730	It may be tomorrow - but it may be later.
12731	I've done a lot in that building.
12732	Music is all consuming.
12733	The results are very positive.
12734	Which is where we come in.
12735	I'm not looking forward to it.
12736	Next league matches, Aberdeen - Dundee United.
12737	He is a pro.
12738	They have to tell it as it is.
12739	This could easily have been another tragedy.
12740	You should enjoy the day.
12741	He was taken ill in his office.
12742	We couldn't get enough of it.
12743	Cost is a factor, but not the only one.
12744	It is just a statement of fact.
12745	It was on my mind a little bit.
12746	I didn't think about it again.
12747	And if they fail?
12748	We've always had something to do.
12749	It will be released in October.
12750	A kind of effective treatment would be welcomed.
12751	It's a matter for the Committee.
12752	It was highly successful.
12753	We needed someone and we now have him.
12754	Only one was from Glasgow.
12755	I'm sure he will be aware of it.
12756	They received no money under the merger.
12757	She has never mentioned it.
12758	It seems to have been an own goal.
12759	There are no second chances.
12760	And it was great for me.
12761	It has still to be recovered.
12762	I wish they would commit to us.
12763	The driver just insulted me.
12764	That is the sensible outcome.
12765	This means a lot of hard decisions.
12766	And so did the rest of her team.
12767	He tells the truth and that's important.
12768	Those are difficult decisions.
12769	The omens are not good.
12770	The game was there to be won.
12771	Then there's the casting.
12772	We can't go on like this.
12773	It is a very demanding course.
12774	Can he do it?
12775	If they wish to go, they can go.
12776	I was just aghast.
12777	They get money for it now.
12778	That's not the way to think.
12779	Then everyone must consider their future.
12780	There was nothing she could do.
12781	We want to be part of it.
12782	This is positive and welcome.
12783	Anything less will not do.
12784	That is clearly not happening fast enough.
12785	They will be very physical.
12786	It has been well worth it.
12787	It was just a feeling.
12788	People are trying to run away.
12789	On the face of it, this is excellent news.
12790	This is clearly not abuse.
12791	He should be careful.
12792	Everyone knew the family.
12793	We will be working on that this week, all right.
12794	The pace is telling.
12795	She has always been very friendly.
12796	Their loss is heartbreaking.
12797	It is his script.
12798	I am a socialist.
12799	The response was really good.
12800	You can blame the defence.
12801	Usually the enjoyment is two ways.
12802	It just could be a good night.
12803	It is an outrage.
12804	It is a performance.
12805	It is the best place.
12806	We tried to get them down.
12807	There were other problems for Brown yesterday.
12808	Part-time staff are being laid off.
12809	I just want him to win a tournament.
12810	Eight others are also believed to have died.
12811	I will never see my son again.
12812	But it is being pursued.
12813	He knew they were there.
12814	We didn't and it cost us the game.
12815	It attracted no complaints.
12816	Neil is never going to come back.
12817	Four of the victims were women.
12818	He was also very happy to listen.
12819	Sadly it is a mess.
12820	That has to take its toll.
12821	But those days are dead and gone.
12822	However we must not be complacent.
12823	And that was just the start.
12824	That was my last game.
12825	Colour is another problem.
12826	It came in bits and pieces.
12827	You don't see that.
12828	They seem to be, anyway.
12829	I thought they were just excited.
12830	He will appear in court today.
12831	Or is he?
12832	Was he confident about his prospects?
12833	It's been very difficult.
12834	Do something that we need.
12835	There is no other offer on the table.
12836	When she returned, it was a wreck.
12837	He is not the only one.
12838	We call it marriage.
12839	It's not the tour.
12840	So what is the secret of the success?
12841	It is still under discussion with the board.
12842	That is one point of view.
12843	Here we go then.
12844	No reason was given.
12845	I can't wait for it to come out.
12846	Indeed, that has already begun.
12847	But it's the truth.
12848	We have been here before.
12849	And he did that.
12850	His remarks were disgraceful.
12851	I did not think it was very proper.
12852	I will never forget that.
12853	It was considered to be topical.
12854	Well, that's all right then.
12855	No-one is a winner in this.
12856	What do you think?
12857	If we don't do it, someone else will.
12858	Again, there was no detail.
12859	Let the voters decide.
12860	Then it will come.
12861	I will build a house on the site.
12862	That is a dangerous assumption.
12863	Does it make a profit?
12864	They are already there.
12865	I'd never given up on myself.
12866	The concerns were unfounded.
12867	I have some comments.
12868	You have to be realistic.
12869	There was nowhere for him to go.
12870	Not that he was complaining.
12871	We are very proud of him.
12872	There they were, making excuses for him.
12873	It just got out of control.
12874	It's all about unfinished business.
12875	Our own people are coming over on Friday.
12876	In Scotland, there should be vigilance.
12877	Yet the job is far from over.
12878	He has a point.
12879	It is our other home.
12880	When you think you cannot go on, you can.
12881	It is their day.
12882	They are a very good side, without a doubt.
12883	They are used to it.
12884	And we are doing it.
12885	It's just not good enough.
12886	You've got to hand it to them.
12887	Next League matches, Aberdeen - Dundee.
12888	And that was the real problem.
12889	But then the problems began.
12890	From the opening Could It Be Magic?
12891	The duties are still to be drawn up.
12892	That there would be discussions.
12893	It must not happen.
12894	That would be unsafe.
12895	I did not go looking anywhere else.
12896	We had no idea what was going on.
12897	If only it had been.
12898	So far, it is no more.
12899	He could have given them a lot.
12900	It was up to him.
12901	It's going to happen.
12902	I don't think so.
12903	And that was just about that.
12904	It is really special to me.
12905	This is a major step forward.
12906	They haven't got the uniform.
12907	Well, you don't have time.
12908	It is very funny.
12909	This is good news for the industry.
12910	What do we have to do?
12911	It's about New Yorkers.
12912	He certainly would have approved.
12913	Conditions were less than ideal.
12914	Father is on the train.
12915	It could have been prevented.
12916	Firstly, we don't know we can do this.
12917	Everything is coming together well.
12918	But we are not afraid of them.
12919	They thought they couldn't get any.
12920	This idea is a good starting point.
12921	What sort of man is that?
12922	We are going nowhere.
12923	It is truly masterly performance.
12924	It has a rally instead of a conference.
12925	I found that we couldn't.
12926	He is very sensitive.
12927	That can benefit the larger companies.
12928	We are very, very confident.
12929	It is a result we should savour.
12930	We certainly do not intend to disband.
12931	My life is going to go on.
12932	It's really part of our mission.
12933	That was only the start.
12934	But what took them so long?
12935	But there are no plans.
12936	I have a very strong opinion about this.
12937	His mother was English.
12938	It's not Big Brother at sea.
12939	The chances were plentiful.
12940	This is only one example.
12941	But this was refused.
12942	Hasn't let anyone down?
12943	He is one of them.
12944	And there has been a good start.
12945	I feel my parents are in New York.
12946	Policing the profession is important.
12947	She had no chance.
12948	In the meantime, you just have to get on with it.
12949	I don't have a problem with it.
12950	It's more relaxing this way.
12951	Allison is not convinced.
12952	We have to move forward from now on.
12953	I am going to win the next two.
12954	She's afraid of life.
12955	But there is good and bad.
12956	That is her job.
12957	I don't know what it means.
12958	I have to accept that.
12959	It means the margin for error is tight.
12960	It's not my fault.
12961	I know he meant it.
12962	There have been so many.
12963	The fire was still coming down.
12964	It's always the way.
12965	I got the surprise of my life.
12966	I accept that, but it is very upsetting.
12967	I had never done anything like it before.
12968	But he thought the overall results were good.
12969	I had been hoping for justice.
12970	The building was starting to come down.
12971	There is a subtle difference.
12972	He has created the confusion.
12973	He didn't get out much.
12974	She was very different.
12975	That is my dream.
12976	The problem is not confined to Glasgow.
12977	The choice is simple.
12978	I don't think we deserved to lose.
12979	I have nothing to regret.
12980	And he still is.
12981	However, the story has a happy ending.
12982	It was his greatest movie performance.
12983	We go back a long way.
12984	Not that he's declined.
12985	People also have trouble with the currency.
12986	I always wanted her to be happy.
12987	We've got to get back to normal.
12988	Do we want to see it?
12989	That is for certain.
12990	An inquiry has begun.
12991	That is not, however, the case.
12992	Only two players have done it.
12993	He is a master of deceit and delay.
12994	What was that all about?
12995	This is a fine appointment.
12996	That was the finest moment in my career.
12997	England will be quite prepared.
12998	He is appealing to women.
12999	I thought he was at fault.
13000	I think he's done it a few times.
13001	This is a business.
13002	I never had any real direction at school.
13003	That's how it works.
13004	It is quite a young team, so the future is there.
13005	Do what you want to do.
13006	Who are the public?
13007	But we have learned that it doesn't.
13008	Glasgow is a very welcoming place.
13009	It was crucial strike.
13010	What do you want to say?
13011	I was so relieved.
13012	They continue to do so.
13013	It is a worry.
13014	It was all relative.
13015	No wonder he missed the conversion.
13016	Sadly, they did not.
13017	We have nowhere to go.
13018	He has every right to do that.
13019	That had never happened.
13020	You mean he didn't get the girl?
13021	But the killing will continue.
13022	But we are working together for this result.
13023	In saying that, you just have to get on with it.
13024	So what went wrong?
13025	We did not play well.
13026	So, how did you do?
13027	We could have done without this.
13028	He's a great dealer.
13029	I want to concentrate on the real issues.
13030	We are moving on.
13031	This is not a crisis.
13032	There's always a chance.
13033	That's a very serious matter.
13034	Sad to say, it's still waiting.
13035	It has been a major success.
13036	It takes a bit of working out.
13037	I'm very relaxed about that indeed.
13038	He will not be coming back.
13039	I don't see any problem.
13040	Let us hope it doesn't come to that.
13041	I have never felt so well.
13042	There are other things going on.
13043	All is now forgiven.
13044	So who is right?
13045	There will be new memories.
13046	But we all have to look at ourselves.
13047	He did it all for us.
13048	I don't think that is good enough.
13049	Of course it is.
13050	That is my commitment.
13051	This is the only problem with the story.
13052	It is good news for us.
13053	The timing is obvious.
13054	I don't think it's very real.
13055	I think she was right.
13056	Is that what people want?
13057	CHRISTMAS is special, a time for reflection.
13058	The time commitment is the biggest thing.
13059	It is quite hard to track.
13060	It's not going to last five minutes.
13061	It was quite an ordeal for them.
13062	Doesn't matter what you do.
13063	O no it's not!
13064	He was their leader.
13065	They are a very good team.
13066	So there we are.
13067	It doesn't make me feel any better.
13068	The incident is dead.
13069	We are delighted with the result.
13070	They will do something big.
13071	The programme was awful.
13072	I am feeling on top of the world.
13073	Doesn't he miss it?
13074	They went down together.
13075	We were getting very worried.
13076	You can't really compare.
13077	Plot is not the issue.
13078	We should not be complacent.
13079	We all want the same things.
13080	SO, that is it for another year.
13081	We are not getting him back.
13082	It's a good offer by any standards.
13083	Yes, it took time to recover.
13084	The potential is always in the idea.
13085	I am not a frustrated actor.
13086	I never got anything out of it.
13087	Locate in Scotland also refused to comment.
13088	That is why he is so special.
13089	This is a very serious matter.
13090	It's going to be great!
13091	That's a good sign.
13092	He declined to be more specific.
13093	We want everyone to have a good time.
13094	We're going to rebuild.
13095	We are trying to do it properly.
13096	We actually had a laugh about that.
13097	I had no idea.
13098	As indeed it did.
13099	He got the part.
13100	It's never been to committee.
13101	It was actually very, very difficult.
13102	The proposals were not new.
13103	His party never arrived.
13104	Visitors are directed instantly to the shop.
13105	He gave no other details.
13106	It's not an improvement for him.
13107	It certainly is cause for concern.
13108	It's on with a roller.
13109	I think we're a long way forward.
13110	The impact was immediate.
13111	His film is not.
13112	That is good news.
13113	He will never be forgotten.
13114	He was very grateful for his health.
13115	The nation has his music.
13116	But real life is not like that.
13117	So now we know.
13118	There has been a reduction in cleaning standards.
13119	We were upset about the referee.
13120	That is our objective.
13121	He is not alone.
13122	He did that last Sunday.
13123	The club is afflicted by injuries.
13124	Sentencing is also being considered in that review.
13125	Lovely day isn't it?
13126	The show is not over.
13127	This is a judgment issue.
13128	It was just an accident.
13129	We are not commenting at the moment.
13130	Somebody should have noticed that something was wrong.
13131	All the time, that number was coming down and down.
13132	That can only be a good thing.
13133	I have never seen anything like this.
13134	It was that kind of war.
13135	He later told The Herald, It is true.
13136	It has come a long way since then.
13137	It was decided he should be dismissed.
13138	But someone has got to do it.
13139	We have not given up.
13140	It was the turning point of the afternoon.
13141	What has happened?
13142	If they are not, the commission will take action.
13143	Where will the money come from?
13144	I can't get it.
13145	It's somewhere in between.
13146	I am the head.
13147	It can be very worrying.
13148	It's harder, believe me.
13149	We are making no comment.
13150	I sit at home a lot.
13151	That was certainly the case for the parties.
13152	I hope the couples are still together.
13153	But that is not enough.
13154	These people are helpless.
13155	Sadly, it is not to be.
13156	I welcome this Bill.
13157	This is not a problem.
13158	he announced his plans.
13159	He is the man to beat.
13160	We are getting not a penny.
13161	Look at the turn-out.
13162	It is very simple.
13163	There was something special about that.
13164	Things are going well.
13165	I was deeply worried.
13166	Maybe it will work there.
13167	How does it all work?
13168	There's a lot of it going on.
13169	It would be a masterclass.
13170	I didn't really expect to be called up.
13171	They will not be going back.
13172	The progress has been steady.
13173	It has no chance.
13174	We have been extremely busy.
13175	It appears to have been successful.
13176	This is a big game for them.
13177	We still have to wait for that.
13178	I feel a little betrayed.
13179	I live for today.
13180	I have been very stupid.
13181	But that was his nature.
13182	We have been together for five years.
13183	So what's in store?
13184	He didn't know where to look.
13185	There are two characters.
13186	The only trouble is finding them.
13187	That was a huge experience.
13188	Will he be here for the weekend?
13189	Now is the time for action.
13190	They were not consulted.
13191	He had an apartment ready.
13192	The prime minister will make the decision.
13193	It was far more important than that.
13194	Their appeal will be heard this week.
13195	A decision is expected tomorrow.
13196	I wanted to get on with it.
13197	I don't think it's the area.
13198	I really had to concentrate.
13199	The training will take place in Downing Street.
13200	We have still got the fight in us.
13201	I wanted to have a go.
13202	We got on very well.
13203	We can all understand that.
13204	You are going to have to do it.
13205	I was amazed at her knowledge.
13206	Where is the evidence?
13207	It was important in training terms.
13208	Ours is on for two days.
13209	We don't want that at all.
13210	We don't come here for our health.
13211	That in itself is a joke.
13212	They know nothing about the sport.
13213	But we shall have to talk to him.
13214	Well, we know now.
13215	He was only doing his job.
13216	The legal process could last weeks.
13217	I can do this on my own.
13218	By then it was too late.
13219	I'm so looking forward to it.
13220	I think we can do well.
13221	That ignorance is crucial.
13222	Clearly, there was a mix-up.
13223	I have not had much of him.
13224	We are taking no chances this time.
13225	He is to be commended.
13226	I don't feel like working.
13227	Then one day it happened.
13228	I sit in the car.
13229	We would like to see them in court.
13230	It is not a soap opera.
13231	Whatever we do, we know we can do well.
13232	They may not always be so lucky.
13233	Where was the point in all this?
13234	He was travelling to see his daughter.
13235	Two other men have recovered.
13236	She is under police escort.
13237	However, that is not in itself enough.
13238	That should not be their conclusion.
13239	We're going to fight it.
13240	Now we have had enough.
13241	He is certainly not looking for another job.
13242	I have a problem with these things.
13243	The gap is closing.
13244	And the other winners are.
13245	It was quite a sight.
13246	But he was far from alone.
13247	The Believer isn't just a movie.
13248	The best team won.
13249	It being the weekend, there was no-one there.
13250	I want to make a difference.
13251	He will have it within two weeks.
13252	How do you feel?
13253	It was not the right time for me.
13254	Not all women are dismayed.
13255	It is not just in Edinburgh.
13256	It's never happened before.
13257	It was a deeper deception.
13258	Norton was delighted with his successes.
13259	There is another side to it.
13260	It will be very damaging for research.
13261	I'm a bit overwhelmed.
13262	The Old Firm are growing.
13263	They want to win the title.
13264	Her concerns were not without foundation.
13265	That would be the constructive way forward.
13266	That is taking place in Strathclyde.
13267	He was in a mood.
13268	This is an awful lot of money.
13269	He was a national treasure.
13270	We need to regroup.
13271	He is in a lot of pain, it is very distressing.
13272	I just had to go for it.
13273	It seems to go down well.
13274	I don't know, really.
13275	Therefore there is a threat.
13276	She would love it.
13277	One was taken to hospital.
13278	Gritty he did not want.
13279	Nobody was able to escape.
13280	Secondly, there is the question of money.
13281	He was later deported.
13282	I only found out about it this morning.
13283	One might think that it is a power.
13284	This place is outstanding.
13285	But it is a fact.
13286	They never seem to do anything about it.
13287	We're going to sleep.
13288	It was great fun.
13289	Experience in this work is paramount.
13290	It is not needed, it should go.
13291	She had not suffered any physical injury.
13292	We have a business to run.
13293	We have been overwhelmed by the response.
13294	And there are others.
13295	I think we did well.
13296	Only two things are certain.
13297	Just look at his record.
13298	I have no evidence.
13299	We were very unhappy with the incident.
13300	It is something that we would support.
13301	We are in shock.
13302	Does it really matter?
13303	I loved it - and so did my friend.
13304	I am enjoying it.
13305	It wasn't very pretty to watch.
13306	You have to go for it.
13307	Are these immoral?
13308	It has been a massive success.
13309	It is for the same reason.
13310	He will have something to say.
13311	You can't take a chance.
13312	She doesn't know where to begin.
13313	I'm not allowed to speak to anyone.
13314	There's nothing she can't do.
13315	I'd love the chance to play for Scotland.
13316	He died in September.
13317	It was not even this century.
13318	That was really tough.
13319	Overall, it has certainly worked out.
13320	This is actually true.
13321	Both were reduced to rubble.
13322	It could have taken another two months.
13323	Is that not pathetic?
13324	That would be a big step forward.
13325	Prime minister Blair is not that way.
13326	But at the moment there isn't the budget.
13327	It is not a matter of concern.
13328	We're not either of those things.
13329	The man has already had too many chances.
13330	It shouldn't be a problem.
13331	It was very moving, actually.
13332	It isn't a free-for-all.
13333	PENSIONS have been hitting the headlines.
13334	I was not fit enough and it showed.
13335	I thought it was the only way out.
13336	We welcome the ministers decision.
13337	Since then it has become a tradition.
13338	The concept is simple.
13339	That is how the Farmer is feeling today.
13340	And that's the trouble with this business.
13341	So what did he do?
13342	What do you think they said?
13343	There will be no disruption in the schools.
13344	I can live with that.
13345	There is no doubt about that.
13346	The president took offence.
13347	The family is so happy for him.
13348	No-one knows the numbers.
13349	It is not the fault of one man, of course.
13350	It's not going to work.
13351	I see no need to change.
13352	They've got more time.
13353	This was a massive result for us.
13354	He wanted to talk to me about it.
13355	No-one has spoken to me.
13356	I was close enough.
13357	I support the stand that they are making.
13358	But was it really so big?
13359	Nature will not find its own level.
13360	I didn't have the choice.
13361	But this has already been rejected.
13362	They have not seen her for years.
13363	He felt there was no case to answer.
13364	This is a one-off.
13365	He liked to talk.
13366	Lots of others were doing the same.
13367	This is a horrible loss.
13368	We are not leaving the area.
13369	Success in Scotland is important.
13370	It was just great.
13371	We don't know what is happening to them.
13372	It's an old story.
13373	It was an important part of the course.
13374	It has been a great success.
13375	I will be trying to do better tomorrow.
13376	It is part of their job.
13377	This decision is a victory for common sense.
13378	One is too many.
13379	What can you say?
13380	The money all appears to be gone.
13381	He was extremely ill.
13382	This time, it was not be.
13383	They are unable to say anything.
13384	The timing is wrong.
13385	He will be fine.
13386	But he's a very quiet man.
13387	It's not their fault.
13388	New investment will be openly tendered.
13389	I'd never have called a doctor for myself.
13390	It is sponsored by The Herald.
13391	It was the rugby writers dinner in London.
13392	It's a good story.
13393	It was too soon.
13394	It is an absolute disgrace.
13395	I don't think it is the case.
13396	Everyone would have been happy.
13397	It has paid off.
13398	Ferguson had done his homework.
13399	He deserved that much.
13400	Mr Blair defended his wife.
13401	He has gone back to school.
13402	I don't know where it went.
13403	There was nothing anyone could do.
13404	I really feel sorry for the Irish.
13405	Now they have to do something about it.
13406	I hope that doesn't happen.
13407	We must do that.
13408	England will be under a lot of pressure.
13409	This has been fantastic.
13410	I'm delighted for the lads.
13411	It's very very frustrating.
13412	We want him to continue that way.
13413	So it was in politics.
13414	The matter has been reported to the police.
13415	We are at war.
13416	We do know the reaction of the SAC.
13417	The state is controlled by the left.
13418	Despite that, it was a great day for me.
13419	I would say the risk is very small.
13420	And there are different perspectives.
13421	Mr Wallace was unimpressed.
13422	The hearing continues today.
13423	On recent evidence, he will not be missed.
13424	The attitude was good today.
13425	I've got nothing to say.
13426	It requires a wider team.
13427	It is so beautiful.
13428	It is suitable and sensible.
13429	In many ways it was disastrous.
13430	I am really, really happy.
13431	I'm not interested in money.
13432	I'm looking forward to racing Donovan.
13433	I can handle the pace.
13434	I am happy to be here.
13435	We are seeking a meeting with the Minister.
13436	I believe it would have been successful.
13437	It's happened, but it's a dream.
13438	I had a son.
13439	It was very, very frightening.
13440	I had no choice.
13441	What do you do.
13442	It would also delay the Scottish results.
13443	This one would have been.
13444	We just have to improve.
13445	It hasn't worked out that way.
13446	This is very good news.
13447	There is nothing wrong with that.
13448	I could not believe the results.
13449	What do you do?
13450	And there are some interesting conductors, too.
13451	It was all over for us then.
13452	Thankfully they liked it.
13453	We just do not do it.
13454	It had happened to him.
13455	That is our business.
13456	We were completely outplayed.
13457	The car driver was not injured.
13458	It was a surprising decision.
13459	I believe in having difficult times.
13460	It was something special.
13461	It was really surprising.
13462	It was a nightmare.
13463	But this is just the first step.
13464	We can do it.
13465	This is as bad as it gets.
13466	We deserved to get the victory today.
13467	It would be a bonus for this game.
13468	I've seen it work already.
13469	Israeli forces denied the claim.
13470	This could be the case.
13471	I have got to keep the lid on.
13472	Or so we thought.
13473	For many, it had become a fact of life.
13474	It was a definite penalty.
13475	It's great fun to get to act.
13476	It goes in cycles.
13477	And now he has decided, enough.
13478	Visiting fans were banned from attending the game.
13479	He made no comment.
13480	We have to get on with it.
13481	He was at the game, and he is indeed.
13482	It would be dangerous to resign.
13483	It is a victory to that extent.
13484	I certainly hope so.
13485	It does and it doesn't.
13486	I was the willing journeyman.
13487	I know we ask a lot of you.
13488	When he got up he was hit again.
13489	It was just one man.
13490	It's going to be tough.
13491	You will be very, very welcome.
13492	I really want to win in Glasgow.
13493	Is he any good?
13494	It was then that Rangers scored.
13495	This was repeated the second time.
13496	I chose the former.
13497	Sub Not Used, McKee.
13498	They were very responsive.
13499	We're talking to him.
13500	This isn't some form of commission.
13501	The game today is certainly different.
13502	And that was just for starters.
13503	I was contacted this morning.
13504	He didn't want me to leave the house.
13505	It's not just a challenge for us.
13506	I've had a ball.
13507	As a player you have to move on.
13508	I am inclined to play it down.
13509	His condition was serious but stable.
13510	We have a problem.
13511	The net is closing.
13512	That took a long time to happen.
13513	Where is the discipline?
13514	This time it is official.
13515	That money could have been coming to Scotland.
13516	I'd love to do another Olympics.
13517	What method of funding is being used?
13518	This is a great day.
13519	and their remit is limited.
13520	There is no question of dithering.
13521	I'm working at the moment.
13522	However, this is only the start.
13523	It was a sickening sight.
13524	We are at an advanced stage, and are now instructing counsel.
13525	I don't think it would make any difference.
13526	If that is not a warning, what is it?
13527	I fell in love with it.
13528	That's not going to happen again.
13529	Paterson was the man.
13530	The course is in great condition.
13531	It's up to them.
13532	They went to the press.
13533	We are very pleased.
13534	They are a good team.
13535	The contest was already over.
13536	It was the only possible decision.
13537	Where is the logic in that?
13538	I told the players that at half-time.
13539	And so it should.
13540	But opinion was divided.
13541	Next league matches Motherwell.
13542	I have been there already.
13543	Scott and Emily were so happy.
13544	It is a step up.
13545	That's the kind of production it was.
13546	Little girls are his victims.
13547	The statement was a lie.
13548	It is the manager's decision.
13549	There's no reason for panic.
13550	We have got away with it.
13551	It was just one of those days.
13552	She has been unable to work since.
13553	No-one has ever seen inside.
13554	Archer is no newcomer to the stage.
13555	It's a matter of time.
13556	It was so unfair.
13557	That is just not true.
13558	History is made at the Masters.
13559	Not so, he insisted.
13560	I wonder what they listen to?
13561	Does a lot of drawing.
13562	That is bad enough.
13563	We need to think.
13564	We are very happy with the verdict.
13565	For once it wasn't about money.
13566	That doesn't happen in Europe.
13567	It's always somebody else's.
13568	It is just so sad.
13569	It all depends on the Chancellor.
13570	It was not pretty.
13571	It was like a scene from the Holocaust.
13572	This is certainly not the case.
13573	Our thoughts are with his family.
13574	I am expecting to win.
13575	We don't need to change the law.
13576	That is partly true, but there are ways of doing it.
13577	We can only do that for so long.
13578	Where do you start?
13579	We are delighted with that.
13580	I had a good life at Rangers.
13581	Just a year later he was dead.
13582	I don't know them or anything.
13583	I've already got this.
13584	But it has all been worthwhile.
13585	This is as bad as it can get.
13586	There was a hell of a row.
13587	It really is good to be back.
13588	It will never happen.
13589	We cannot go on like this.
13590	The biggest thing is structure.
13591	This is great news for us.
13592	We certainly have to try something.
13593	What is that?
13594	He has two children.
13595	It was a matter of choice.
13596	So what is their secret?
13597	I have been struggling with my form.
13598	That was about it.
13599	It is coming on very well.
13600	We won't go down without a struggle.
13601	We were unlucky not to score.
13602	And that brings us to the point.
13603	It's a good start.
13604	One person had a broken back.
13605	I hope that is the lucky break.
13606	It is almost like a family.
13607	My game is coming back.
13608	It was a game they could have won.
13609	It is a matter for Westminster.
13610	This is the goal.
13611	I want to get at the truth.
13612	Everyone here is very sad.
13613	I am not changing my mind.
13614	What's the best thing to do?
13615	For tragedy it is.
13616	We are all very pleased.
13617	They do it properly.
13618	I just don't know what she was doing.
13619	You can't have both.
13620	I will have to think about it.
13621	Well, you can't have everything.
13622	They have not given them the evidence.
13623	I certainly will not settle.
13624	I don't make it mystical.
13625	Neither could be contacted last night.
13626	That clearly wasn't what they wanted.
13627	And well he might.
13628	Next year this time we will be home.
13629	It will be crucial.
13630	The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their homes in the sky.
13631	I am not interested in the past.
13632	I've got to be pleased with that.
13633	They have done nothing of the sort.
13634	We are doing well.
13635	Fuller was the difference.
13636	However, you never know.
13637	Who did it doesn't really matter.
13638	I was all alone.
13639	A major is a major.
13640	I'm looking forward to the next two weeks.
13641	And that is about it.
13642	It will be great.
13643	It was a good win for us.
13644	It has not come.
13645	It has really been quite appalling.
13646	It will not work a second time.
13647	The best defence is a good offence.
13648	That is the case and remains the case.
13649	It was nice to come back.
13650	It's a step forward.
13651	That is the worry.
13652	It's just not very nice.
13653	We're still in the process of making changes.
13654	I probably was wrong.
13655	After that, it's never the same again.
13656	It is not just about the money.
13657	But the casting is also bizarre.
13658	Now is not the moment to leave.
13659	It's the start of something new.
13660	It doesn't mean that much.
13661	We are not giving up.
13662	We had never seen him before.
13663	The car was perfect.
13664	It was good to work with them.
13665	She failed to win another game.
13666	As well it might be.
13667	That is no bad thing.
13668	It is a lot of fun.
13669	That would be a miracle.
13670	This is still not good enough.
13671	I'm really proud of him.
13672	This is very disturbing news.
13673	I am the leader.
13674	There is a pause.
13675	I'd already had them all.
13676	It was a bonus for me really.
13677	Neither has gone to war.
13678	But he will be extremely active.
13679	There was a bit of pressure.
13680	He didn't win the title.
13681	I am still waiting for her.
13682	There is no need for that call.
13683	I have never done that.
13684	I am just in a state of shock.
13685	I really hope he comes back.
13686	Here we go again.
13687	Their attitude was great.
13688	However, the story may have an happy ending.
13689	But he will do anything.
13690	Nothing has been decided yet.
13691	Almost everyone had some input.
13692	I really wanted the part.
13693	It was just a matter of time.
13694	But it's there to be won.
13695	I hope we can still find a solution.
13696	Nothing else will do.
13697	There is a precedent for the theory.
13698	I should be doing that for her.
13699	I don't suppose it matters that much.
13700	We will not get rid of them.
13701	It is no surprise at all.
13702	We are playing good football.
13703	This is a major step forward for the carers.
13704	They are still in shock.
13705	I can't believe that is the way forward.
13706	It's going to be massive.
13707	I have been doing it for years.
13708	What are the likely solutions?
13709	It is just not working.
13710	But they will be less attractive than that.
13711	It seems to be politics at work again.
13712	There would be famine.
13713	It was all image and no substance.
13714	I know it is going to be difficult.
13715	There was no evidence against him.
13716	Anything would be better than this retirement.
13717	I did not feel the pressure.
13718	This is the direction we need to go.
13719	It could really have been a disaster.
13720	I told him to stop.
13721	His strike was superb.
13722	We are looking forward to next season.
13723	It cannot go on for ever like this.
13724	In the event, it was to be the latter.
13725	We are just waiting for news.
13726	They took that away.
13727	There's not going to be a formula.
13728	They have given up.
13729	We are not interested in selling him.
13730	The firm was working.
13731	I was never invited.
13732	I am glad that he is angry.
13733	We were fortunate to get an own goal.
13734	He's a very promising player, indeed.
13735	I was not about to hit him.
13736	They were good neighbours.
13737	Indeed, it has already.
13738	I've never done that before in my life.
13739	On his first public appearance, Mr Cameron found himself under fire.
13740	I got in with a bad crowd.
13741	For career reasons, too, he believed he needed to come home.
13742	I can live here without a problem.
13743	The full price was accepted by them.
13744	When you do you will never want to do any other job.
13745	But you have to give credit to Dunfermline.
13746	However, a year ago things looked so different.
13747	I said My brother, George, never saw that.
13748	At the present moment, she will stay.
13749	First Choice is the clear leader in terms of performance.
13750	The group is currently working to create several substantial new funds.
13751	We're moving from four companies into a single company.
13752	It is too much to take in.
13753	The management team has a hard task ahead.
13754	I can understand fully that Rangers and Celtic want to progress.
13755	Campbell said he hoped to build on that fighting spirit against Hearts.
13756	The campaign ran in Lothian, Fife and Central Scotland police areas.
13757	Tony Blair is taking a computer course.
13758	Offers of company cars and other benefits have also become quite common.
13759	It is no longer the white death.
13760	When I went down I knew it was bad.
13761	It's allowed in the rules he said later.
13762	Woods is not just in control of his golf game.
13763	It's hardly a new strategy in art practice.
13764	Britain will lead demands for the reform of Europe.
13765	I felt my father was very hard.
13766	Once again a strong services performance helped the overall trading position.
13767	I think we can cause a surprise in the first division.
13768	We backed away from writing new songs.
13769	We control every part of your life.
13770	The balance comes from the five enterprise bodies involved.
13771	Six public bodies are behind the plan.
13772	It has too few of its own special forces inside Kosovo.
13773	There were no reports of any injuries.
13774	In our view the stock has financial risk.
13775	We have never been paid that money.
13776	It is a dangerous trip to make for these people.
13777	Getting Kilmarnock so early in the Scottish season could give us a chance.
13778	It was also live on Radio Five.
13779	So on the stadium front, I think we have made our case.
13780	We are too easily beaten as a team.
13781	The property has been for sale for several months.
13782	We have never met a previous Prime Minister.
13783	South Africa is the next likely customer.
13784	But, overall, Aberdeen looks well placed for growth.
13785	The site was launched in the UK on Monday.
13786	He's a man who knows all about forward thinking.
13787	I was told that I've set that new club scoring record.
13788	I'm just as concerned about life and death as you are.
13789	You can see the damage that has been done.
13790	Glasgow has continued to run it on an agency basis.
13791	They were mainly very positive about the role.
13792	But I hope the referee can now go back on his decision.
13793	This will take in dividend policy and capital structure.
13794	Clubs need to have their own drug abuse policies.
13795	In this position, it often takes some time.
13796	I expect to see a different Kilmarnock side tomorrow.
13797	I had several words with the fourth official and was warned.
13798	Opera must get its house in order
13799	I think every coach wants to work daily.
13800	The hotel has a long and happy history.
13801	An English Parliament was never a serious option.
13802	It is not a natural choice for them.
13803	It would not have thought otherwise for one moment.
13804	We've had five weeks with two games really.
13805	But not every story is a success story.
13806	This result has given me much food for thought.
13807	It is vital that the government gets this right.
13808	People like him give rugby a good name.
13809	We have to look towards next season.
13810	I know that you have a love of Scotland.
13811	There was no plan B if the Good Friday Agreement failed, he warned.
13812	His home is provided by the government.
13813	But the town has great potential as a book town.
13814	He is not quite as confident as he appears.
13815	Does the name matter ?
13816	how do you get it back ?
13817	What are you not good at ?
13818	Overall, though, it was an easy Sunday afternoon for Kilmarnock.
13819	A Home Office spokeswoman said she was unable to comment on individual cases.
13820	We are delighted, nothing else, just delighted.
13821	We will be taking a world lead.
13822	Private sector pay awards were a major factor.
13823	However, Hamilton had a different version of events.
13824	Do they think anyone else wants them ?
13825	But I'm a lot of other things, too.
13826	I enjoyed this summer, which is a big difference from last year.
13827	Even if it did, my views wouldn't change.
13828	He did not provide us with a proposal.
13829	But I was not up for the title.
13830	His own boys say the same about him.
13831	The only plus point is the reduction in crime.
13832	I am convinced that this is a subject which can make a difference.
13833	Larsson is clearly the form player just now.
13834	If he could have taken those words back, he would have.
13835	The group has been hit hard by security operations in Ireland.
13836	Some analysts said a share split seemed likely.
13837	Consumers have generally accepted this process to date.
13838	I would not want to be famous for nothing.
13839	The Russian described his defeat as a bad day at the office.
13840	Mitchell hit a post from a penalty in front.
13841	Or we could do a trade sale.
13842	Their job is to show whether any disease remains.
13843	I was better prepared than a year ago.
13844	The package of measures and extra cash are a major step forward.
13845	We can get back on track with that.
13846	In short, he is the wrong candidate, but the right man.
13847	We even changed the system three times but it didn't help.
13848	People are determined to get it right.
13849	We are putting in place training programmes to improve skills.
13850	You get better at putting on a face for the world.
13851	I am confident that the estate workers will have a secure future.
13852	That has been the story all through this season, really.
13853	The sale of Murray Johnstone should be completed early in the fourth quarter.
13854	This may help in the short term but not beyond March.
13855	In fact, he is very much a Kilmarnock man.
13856	Perhaps we should learn something from them.
13857	Stewart ruled out a return of this cash to shareholders, however.
13858	Local and national phone calls will be free.
13859	Neither issued any statement after the hearing.
13860	And so it is with young companies.
13861	It's always a difficult game against England.
13862	Two goals in nine minutes wasn't bad.
13863	In football terms, though, Kilmarnock are well in the black.
13864	Paul Taylor, a spokesman for the American university, confirmed the appointment yesterday.
13865	Life will not be all work, however.
13866	The Farmer is doing the whole of August.
13867	Most of the affected jobs are in the US.
13868	None of the fire has been lost.
13869	The two cases are about exactly the same thing.
13870	But the German product failed safety tests.
13871	They wanted them to move fast, but some couldn't.
13872	Jones said she was there to show my complete support for my husband.
13873	Like some others, he is still to improve himself a lot.
13874	Lead feet were the order of the day.
13875	This trial has brought the focus back on the inquiry.
13876	That had happened long before half-time yesterday.
13877	New York provided little help for the London market.
